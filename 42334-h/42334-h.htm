<blockquote>

<p>"And the Lord called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the

<p>Perhaps no book in the Bible presents to the
ordinary reader so many and peculiar difficulties
as the book of Leviticus. Even of those who devoutly
believe, as they were taught in their childhood, that,
like all the other books contained in the Holy Scriptures,
it is to be received throughout with unquestioning
faith as the very Word of God, a large number will
frankly own in a discouraged way that this is with
them merely a matter of belief, which their personal
experience in reading the book has for the most part
failed to sustain; and that for them so to see through
symbol and ritual as to get much spiritual profit from
such reading has been quite impossible.</p>

<p>A larger class, while by no means denying or
doubting the original Divine authority of this book,
yet suppose that the elaborate ritual of the Levitical
law, with its multiplied, minute prescriptions regarding
matters religious and secular, since the Mosaic dispensation
has now long passed away, neither has nor
can have any living relation to present-day questions
of Christian belief and practice; and so, under this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
impression, they very naturally trouble themselves little
with a book which, if they are right, can now only be
of special interest to the religious antiquarian.</p>

<p>Others, again, while sharing this feeling, also confess
to a great difficulty which they feel in believing that
many of the commands of this law can ever have been
really given by inspiration from God. The extreme
severity of some of the laws, and what seems to them
to be the arbitrary and even puerile character of other
prescriptions, appear to them to be irreconcilable, in
the one case, with the mercy, in the other, with the
dignity and majesty, of the Divine Being.</p>

<p>With a smaller, but, it is to be feared, an increasing
number, this feeling, either of indifference or of doubt,
regarding the book of Leviticus, is further strengthened
by their knowledge of the fact that in our day its
Mosaic origin and inspired authority is strenuously
denied by a large number of eminent scholars, upon
grounds which they claim to be strictly scientific. And
if such Christians do not know enough to decide for
themselves on its merits the question thus raised, they
at least know enough to have a very uncomfortable
doubt whether an intelligent Christian has any longer
a right to regard the book as in any true sense the
Word of God; and&mdash;what is still more serious&mdash;they
feel that the question is of such a nature that it is impossible
for any one who is not a specialist in Hebrew
and the higher criticism to reach any well-grounded
and settled conviction, one way or the other, on the
subject. Such persons, of course, have little to do
with this book. If the Word of God is indeed there,
it cannot reach them.</p>

<p>With such mental conditions so widely prevailing,
some words regarding the origin, authority, purpose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
and use of this book of Leviticus seem to be a necessary
preliminary to its profitable exposition.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Origin and Authority of Leviticus.</span></p>

<p>As to the origin and authority of this book, the first
verse presents a very formal and explicit statement:
"The Lord called unto Moses, and spake unto him."
These words evidently contain by necessary implication
two affirmations: first, that the legislation which immediately
follows is of Mosaic origin: "The Lord spake
unto <em>Moses</em>;" and, secondly, that it was not the product
merely of the mind of Moses, but came to him,
in the first instance, as a revelation from Jehovah:
"<em>Jehovah</em> spake unto Moses." And although it is
quite true that the words in this first verse strictly
refer only to that section of the book which immediately
follows, yet, inasmuch as the same or a like formula
is used repeatedly before successive sections,&mdash;in all,
no less than fifty-six times in the twenty-seven chapters,&mdash;these
words may with perfect fairness be regarded
as expressing a claim respecting these two points,
which covers the entire book.</p>

<p>We must not, indeed, put more into these words than
is truly there. They simply and only declare the
Mosaic origin and the inspired authority of the legislation
which the book contains. They say nothing as
to whether or not Moses wrote every word of this book
himself; or whether the Spirit of God directed and
inspired other persons, in Moses' time or afterward,
to commit this Mosaic law to writing. They give us
no hint as to when the various sections which make
up the book were combined into their present literary
form, whether by Moses himself, as is the traditional
view, or by men of God in a later day. As to these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
and other matters of secondary importance which might
be named, the book records no statement. The words
used in the text, and similar expressions used elsewhere,
simply and only declare the legislation to be of
Mosaic origin and of inspired authority. Only, be it
observed, so much as this they do affirm in the most
direct and uncompromising manner.</p>

<p>It is of great importance to note all this: for in the
heat of theological discussion the issue is too often
misapprehended on both sides. The real question,
and, as every one knows, the burning Biblical question
of the day, is precisely this, whether the claim this
book contains, thus exactly defined, is true or false.</p>

<p>A certain school of critics, comprising many of the
greatest learning, and of undoubted honesty of intention,
assures the Church and the world that a strictly
scientific criticism compels one to the conclusion that
this claim, even as thus sharply limited and defined,
is, to use plain words, not true; that an enlightened
scholarship must acknowledge that Moses had little
or nothing to do with what we find in this book; that,
in fact, it did not originate till nearly a thousand years
later, when, after the Babylonian captivity, certain
Jewish priests, desirous of magnifying their authority
with the people, fell on the happy expedient of writing
this book of Leviticus, together with certain other parts
of the Pentateuch, and then, to give the work a prestige
and authority which on its own merits or over their
own names it could not have had, delivered it to their
countrymen as nearly a thousand years old, the work
of their great lawgiver. And, strangest of all, they not
only did this, but were so successful in imposing this
forgery upon the whole nation that history records not
even an expressed suspicion of a single person, until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
modern times, of its non-Mosaic origin; that is, they
succeeded in persuading the whole people of Israel that
a law which they had themselves just promulgated had
been in existence among them for nearly ten centuries,
the very work of Moses, when, in reality, it was quite
a new thing.</p>

<p>Astonishing and even incredible as all this may seem
to the uninitiated, substantially this theory is held by
many of the Biblical scholars of our day as presenting
the essential facts of the case; and the discovery of
these supposed facts we are called upon to admire as
one of the chief literary triumphs of modern critical
scholarship!</p>

<p>Now the average Christian, whether minister or layman,
though intelligent enough in ordinary matters of
human knowledge, or even a well-educated man, is not,
and cannot be, a specialist in Hebrew and in the higher
criticism. What is he then to do when such a theory
is presented to him as endorsed by scholars of the
highest ability and the most extensive learning? Must
we, then, all learn Hebrew and study this higher
criticism before we can be permitted to have any well-justified
and decided opinion whether this book, this
law of Leviticus, be the Word of God or a forgery?
We think not. There are certain considerations, quite
level to the understanding of every one; certain facts,
which are accepted as such by the most eminent
scholars, which ought to be quite sufficient for the
maintenance and the abundant confirmation of our
faith in this book of Leviticus as the very Word of
God to Moses.</p>

<p>In the first place, it is to be observed that if any
theory which denies the Mosaic origin and the inspired
authority of this book be true, then the fifty-six assertions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
of such origin and authority which the book
contains are unqualifiedly false. Further, however
any may seek to disguise the issue with words, if in
fact this Levitical ritual and code of laws came into
existence only after the Babylonian captivity and in
the way suggested, then the book of Leviticus can by
no possibility be the Word of God in any sense, but is
a forgery and a fraud. Surely this needs no demonstration.
"The Lord spake unto Moses," reads, for
instance, this first verse; "The Lord did <em>not</em> speak
these things unto Moses," answer these critics; "they
were invented by certain unscrupulous priests centuries
afterwards." Such is the unavoidable issue.</p>

<p>Now who shall arbitrate in these matters? who
shall settle these questions for the great multitude of
believers who know nothing of Hebrew criticism, and
who, although they may not well understand much that
is in this book, have yet hitherto accepted it with
reverent faith as being what it professes to be, the
very Word of God through Moses? To whom, indeed,
can we refer such a question as this for decision but
to Jesus Christ of Nazareth, our Lord and Saviour,
confessed of all believers to be in verity the only-begotten
Son of God from the bosom of the Father?
For He declared that "the Father showed unto Him,"
the Son, "all things that He Himself did;" He will
therefore be sure to know the truth of this matter,
sure to know the Word of His Father from the word
of man, if He will but speak.</p>

<p>And He has spoken on this matter, He, the Son of
God. What was the common belief of the Jews in the
time of our Lord as to the Mosaic origin and Divine
authority of this book, as of all the Pentateuch, every
one knows. Not a living man disputes the statement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
made by a recent writer on this subject, that "previous
to the Christian era, there are no traces of a second
opinion" on this question; the book "was universally
ascribed to Moses." Now, that Jesus Christ shared
and repeatedly endorsed this belief of His contemporaries
should be perfectly clear to any ordinary
reader of the Gospels.</p>

<p>The facts as to His testimony, in brief, are these.
As to the Pentateuch in general, He called it (Luke
xxiv. 44) "the law of Moses;" and, as regards its
authority, He declared it to be such that "till heaven
and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall in no
wise pass away from the law, till all be fulfilled"
(Matt. v. 18). Could this be truly said of this book
of Leviticus, which is undoubtedly included in this
term, "the law," if it were not the Word of God, but
a forgery, so that its fifty-six affirmations of its Mosaic
origin and inspired authority were false? Again,
Christ declared that Moses in his "writings" wrote
of Him,&mdash;a statement, which, it should be observed,
imputes to Moses foreknowledge, and therefore supernatural
inspiration; and further said that faith in
Himself was so connected with faith in Moses, that if
the Jews had believed Moses, they would have also
believed Him (John v. 46, 47). Is it conceivable
that Christ should have spoken thus, if the "writings"
referred to had been forgeries?</p>

<p>But not only did our Lord thus endorse the Pentateuch
in general, but also, on several occasions, the Mosaic
origin and inspired authority of Leviticus in particular.
Thus, when He healed the lepers (Matt. viii. 4) He
sent them to the priests on the ground that Moses had
commanded this in such cases. But such a command is
found only in this book of Leviticus (xiv. 3-10). Again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
in justifying His disciples for plucking the ears of corn
on the Sabbath day, He adduces the example of David,
who ate the shew-bread when he was an hungered,
"which was not lawful for him to eat, but only for the
priests" (Matt. xii. 4); thus referring to a law which
is only found in Leviticus (xxiv. 9). But the citation
was only pertinent on the assumption that He
regarded the prohibition of the shew-bread as having
the same inspired authority as the obligation of the
Sabbath. In John vii. 32, again, He refers to Moses
as having renewed the ordinance of circumcision, which
at the first had been given to Abraham; and, as usual,
assumes the Divine authority of the command as thus
given. But this renewal of the ordinance of circumcision
is recorded only in Leviticus (xii. 3). Yet
once more, rebuking the Pharisees for their ingenious
justification of the hard-hearted neglect of parents by
undutiful children, He reminds them that Moses had
said that he who cursed father or mother should be put
to death; a law which is only found in the so-called
priest-code, Exod. xxi. 17 and Lev. xx. 9. Further, He
is so far from merely assuming the truth of the Jewish
opinion for the sake of an argument, that He formally
declares this law, equally with the fifth commandment,
to be "a commandment of God," which they by their
tradition had made void (Matt. xiv. 3-6).</p>

<p>One would suppose that it had been impossible to
avoid the inference from all this, that our Lord believed,
and intended to be understood as teaching, that the law
of Leviticus was, in a true sense, of Mosaic origin, and
of inspired, and therefore infallible, authority.</p>

<p>We are in no way concerned, indeed,&mdash;nor is it
essential to the argument,&mdash;to press this testimony of
Christ as proving more than the very least which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
words fairly imply. For instance, nothing in His words,
as we read them, any more than in the language of
Leviticus itself, excludes the supposition that in the
preparation of the law, Moses, like the Apostle Paul,
may have had co-labourers or amanuenses, such as
Aaron, Eleazar, Joshua, or others, whose several parts
of the work might then have been issued under his
endorsement and authority; so that Christ's testimony
is in no wise irreconcilable with the fact of differences
of style, or with the evidence of different documents,
if any think that they discover this, in the book.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>We are willing to go further, and add that in the
testimony of our Lord we find nothing which declares
against the possibility of one or more redactions or
revisions of the laws of Leviticus in post-Mosaic times,
by one or more <em>inspired</em> men; as, <em>e.g.</em>, by Ezra, described
(Ezra vii. 6) as "a ready scribe in the law of
Moses, which the Lord, the God of Israel, had given;"
to whom also ancient Jewish tradition attributes the
final settlement of the Old Testament canon down to his
time. Hence no words of Christ touch the question as
to when the book of Leviticus received its present form,
in respect of the order of its chapters, sections, and
verses. This is a matter of quite secondary importance,
and may be settled any way without prejudice to the
Mosaic origin and authority of the laws it contains.</p>

<p>Neither, in the last place, do the words of our Lord,
carefully weighed, of necessity exclude even the possibility
that such persons, acting under Divine direction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and inspiration, may have first reduced some parts of
the law given by Moses to writing;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> or even, as an
extreme supposition, may have entered here and there,
under the unerring guidance of the Holy Ghost, prescriptions
which, although new as to the letter, were
none the less truly Mosaic, in that by necessary implication
they were logically involved in the original
code.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>We do not indeed here argue either for or against
any of these suppositions, which were apart from the
scope of the present work. We are only concerned
here to remark that Christ has not incontrovertibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
settled these questions. These things may be true or
not true; the decision of such matters properly belongs
to the literary critics. But decide them as one will, it
will still remain true that the law is "the law of
Moses," given by revelation from God.</p>

<p>So much as this, however, is certain. Whatsoever
modifications may conceivably have passed upon the
text, all work of this kind was done, as all agree, long
before the time of our Lord; and the text to which He
refers as of Mosaic origin and of inspired authority,
was therefore essentially the text of Leviticus as we
have it to-day. We are thus compelled to insist that
whatever modifications may have been made in the
original Levitical law, they cannot have been, according
to the testimony of our Lord, such as in any way
conflicted with His affirmation of its Mosaic origin and
its inspired authority. They can thus, at the very
utmost, only have been, as suggested, in the way of
legitimate logical development and application to successive
circumstances, of the Levitical law as originally
given to Moses; and that, too, under the administration
of a priesthood endowed with the possession of the
Urim and Thummim, so as to give such official deliverances,
whenever required, the sanction of inerrant
Divine authority, binding on the conscience as from
God. Here, at least, surely, Christ by His testimony
has placed an immovable limitation upon the speculations
of the critics.</p>

<p>And yet there are those who admit the facts as to
Christ's testimony, and nevertheless claim that without
any prejudice to the absolute truthfulness of our Lord,
we may suppose that in speaking as He did, with
regard to the law of Leviticus, He merely conformed
to the common usage of the Jews, without intending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
thereby to endorse their opinion; any more than, when,
conforming to the ordinary mode of speech, He spoke
of the sun as rising and setting, He meant thereby to
be understood as endorsing the common opinion of
men of that time that the sun actually passed round
the earth every twenty-four hours. To which it is
enough to reply that this illustration, which has so
often been used in this argument, is not relevant to
the case before us. For not only did our Lord use
language which implied the truth of the Jewish belief
regarding the origin and authority of the Mosaic law,
but He formally teaches it; and&mdash;what is of still more
moment&mdash;He rests the obligation of certain duties upon
the fact that this law of Leviticus was a revelation
from God to Moses for the children of Israel. But if
the supposed facts, upon which He bases His argument
in such cases, are, in reality, not facts, then His argument
becomes null and void. How, for instance, is it
possible to explain away the words in which He appeals
to one of the laws of Exodus and Leviticus (Matt. xv.
3-6) as being <em>not</em> a Jewish opinion, but, instead, in
explicit contrast with the traditions of the Rabbis, "a
commandment of God"? Was this expression merely
"an accommodation" to the mistaken notions of the
Jews? If so, then what becomes of His argument?</p>

<p>Others, again, feeling the force of this, and yet
sincerely and earnestly desiring to maintain above
possible impeachment the perfect truthfulness of Christ,
still assuming that the Jews were mistaken, and admitting
that, if so, our Lord must have shared their
error, take another line of argument. They remind us
of what, however mysterious, cannot be denied, that our
Lord, in virtue of His incarnation, came under certain
limitations in knowledge; and then urge that without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
any prejudice to His character we may suppose that, not
only with regard to the time of His advent and kingdom
(Matt. xxiv. 36), but also with respect to the authorship
and the Divine authority of this book of Leviticus,
He may have shared in the ignorance and error of His
countrymen.</p>

<p>But, surely, the fact of Christ's limitation in knowledge
cannot be pressed so far as the argument of such
requires, without by logical necessity nullifying Christ's
mission and authority as a religious teacher. For it
is certain that according to His own word, and the
universal belief of Christians, the supreme object of
Christ's mission was to reveal unto men through His
life and teachings, and especially through His death
upon the cross, the Father; and it is certain that He
claimed to have, in order to this end, perfect knowledge
of the Father. But how could this most essential
claim of His be justified, and how could He be competent
to give unto men a perfect and inerrant knowledge
of the Father, if the ignorance of His humiliation
was so great that He was unable to distinguish from
His Father's Word a book which, by the hypothesis,
was not the Word of the Father, but an ingenious
and successful forgery of certain crafty post-exilian
priests?</p>

<p>It is thus certain that Jesus must have known
whether the Pentateuch, and, in particular, this book
of Leviticus, was the Word of God or not; certain also
that, if the Word of God, it could not have been a
forgery; and equally certain that Jesus could not have
intended in what He said on this subject to accommodate
His speech to a common error of the people, without
thereby endorsing their belief. It thus follows that
critics of the radical school referred to are directly at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
issue with the testimony of Christ regarding this book.
It is of immense consequence that Christians should
see this issue clearly. While Jesus taught in various
ways that Leviticus contains a law given by revelation
from God to Moses, these teach that it is a priestly
forgery of the days after Ezra. Both cannot be right;
and if the latter are in the right, then&mdash;we speak with
all possible deliberation and reverence&mdash;Jesus Christ
was mistaken, and was therefore unable even to tell us
with inerrant certainty whether this or that is the Word
of God or not. But if this is so, then how can we
escape the final inference that His claim to have a perfect
knowledge of the Father must have been an error; His
claim to be the incarnate Son of God, therefore, a false
pretension, and Christianity, a delusion, so that mankind
has in Him no Saviour?</p>

<p>But against so fatal a conclusion stands the great
established fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from
the dead; whereby He was with power declared to be
the Son of God, so that we may know that His word
on this, as on all subjects where He has spoken, settles
controversy, and is a sufficient ground of faith; while
it imposes upon all speculations of men, literary or
philosophical, eternal and irremovable limitations.</p>

<p>Let no one think that the case, as regards the issue
at stake, has been above stated too strongly. One
could not well go beyond the often cited words of
Kuenen on this subject: "We must either cast aside
as worthless our dearly bought scientific method, or we
must for ever cease to acknowledge the authority of the
New Testament in the domain of the exegesis of the
Old." With good reason does another scholar exclaim
at these words, "The Master must not be heard as a
witness! We treat our criminals with more respect."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
So then stands the question this day which this first
verse of Leviticus brings before us: In which have we
more confidence? in literary critics, like a Kuenen or
Wellhausen, or in Jesus Christ? Which is the more
likely to know with certainty whether the law of
Leviticus is a revelation from God or not?</p>

<p>The devout Christian, who through the grace of the
crucified and risen Lord "of whom Moses, in the law,
and the prophets did write," and who has "tasted the
good word of God," will not long hesitate for an answer.
He will not indeed, if wise, timidly or fanatically decry
all literary investigation of the Scriptures; but he will
insist that the critic shall ever hold his reason in
reverent subjection to the Lord Jesus on all points
where the Lord has spoken. Such everywhere will
heartily endorse and rejoice in those admirable words
of the late venerable Professor Delitzsch; words
which stand almost as of his last solemn testament:&mdash;"The
theology of glory which prides itself upon
being its own highest authority, bewitches even those
who had seemed proof against its enchantments; and
the theology of the Cross, which holds Divine folly
to be wiser than men, is regarded as an unscientific
lagging behind the steps of progress.... But the
faith which I professed in my first sermons, ... remains
mine to-day, undiminished in strength, and
immeasurably higher than all earthly knowledge. Even
if in many Biblical questions I have to oppose the
traditional opinion, certainly my opposition rests on
this side of the gulf, on the side of the theology of the
Cross, of grace, of miracles!... By this banner let
us stand; folding ourselves in it, let us die!"<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
which truly noble words every true Christian may well
say, Amen!</p>

<p>We then stand without fear with Jesus Christ in
our view of the origin and authority of the book of
Leviticus.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Occasion and Order of Leviticus.</span></p>

<p>Before proceeding to the exposition of this book, a
few words need to be said regarding its occasion and
plan, and its object and present use.</p>

<p>The opening words of the book, "And the Lord
said," connect it in the closest manner with the preceding
book of Exodus, at the contents of which we have
therefore to glance for a moment. The kingdom of
God, rejected by corporate humanity in the founding of
the Babylonian world-power, but continuing on earth
in a few still loyal souls in the line of Abraham and his
seed, at last, according to promise, had been formally
and visibly re-established on earth at Mount Sinai.
The fundamental law of the kingdom contained in the
ten commandments and certain applications of the
same, had been delivered in what is called the Book of
the Covenant, amid thunders and lightnings, at the holy
mount. Israel had solemnly entered into covenant
with God on this basis, saying, "All these things will
we do and be obedient," and the covenant had been
sealed by the solemn sprinkling of blood.</p>

<p>This being done, Jehovah now issued commandment
for the building of the tabernacle or "tent of meeting,"
where He might manifest His glory and from time to
time communicate His will to Israel. As mediators between
Him and the people, the priesthood was appointed,
their vestments and duties prescribed. All this having
been done as ordered, the tent of meeting covering the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
interior tabernacle was set up; the Shekinah cloud
covered it, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle,&mdash;the
manifested presence of the King of Israel!</p>

<p>Out of the tent of meeting, from this excellent glory,
Jehovah now called unto Moses, and delivered the law
as we have it in the first seven chapters of the book
of Leviticus. To the law of offerings succeeds (viii.-x.)
an account of the consecration of Aaron and his sons
to the priestly office, and their formal public assumption
of their functions, with an account of the very
awful sanction which was given to the preceding law,
by the death of Nadab and Abihu before the Lord, for
offering as He had not commanded them.</p>

<p>The next section of the book contains the law concerning
the clean and the unclean, under the several
heads of food (xi.), birth-defilement (xii.), leprosy
(xiii., xiv.), and unclean issues (xv.); and closes (xvi.)
with the ordinance of the great day of atonement, in
which the high priest alone, presenting the blood of a
sin-offering in the Holy of Holies, was to make atonement
once a year for the sins of the whole nation.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>


<p>The third section of the book contains the law of
holiness,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> first, for the people (xvii.-xx.), and then the
special laws for the priests (xxi., xxii.). These are
followed, first (xxiii.), by the order for the feasts of the
Lord, or appointed times of public holy convocation;
then (xxiv.), by a historical incident designed to show
that the law, as given, must, in several respects noted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
be applied in all its strictness no less to the alien than
to the native-born Israelite; and finally (xxv.), by the
remarkable ordinances concerning the sabbatic year,
and the culmination of the sabbatic system of the law
in the year of jubilee.</p>

<p>As a conclusion to the whole, the legislation thus
given is now sealed (xxvi.) with promises from God of
blessing to the nation if they will keep this law, and
threats of unsparing vengeance against the people and
the land, if they forsake His commandments and break
the covenant, though still with a promise of mercy when,
having thus transgressed, they shall at any time repent.
The book then closes with a supplemental chapter on
voluntary vows and dues (xxvii.).</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Purpose of Leviticus.</span></p>

<p>What now was the purpose of Leviticus? In
general, as regards Israel, it was given to direct them
how they might live as a holy nation in fellowship with
God. The key-note of the book is "Holiness to
Jehovah." More particularly, the object of the book
was to furnish for the theocracy set up in Israel a code
of law which should secure their physical, moral, and
spiritual well-being. But the establishment of the
theocracy in Israel was itself only a means to an end;
namely, to make Israel a blessing to all nations, in
mediating to the Gentiles the redemption of God.
Hence, the Levitical laws were all intended and adapted
to train and prepare the nation for this special historic
mission to which God had chosen them.</p>

<p>To this end, it was absolutely necessary, first of all,
that Israel should be kept separate from the heathen
nations. To effect and maintain this separation, these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
laws of Leviticus were admirably adapted. They are
of such a character, that obedience to them, even in
a very imperfect way, has made the nation to this day
to be, in a manner and degree perfectly unique, isolated
and separate from all the peoples in the midst of whom
they dwell.</p>

<p>The law of Leviticus was intended to effect this
preparation of Israel for its world-mission, not only
in an external manner, but also in an internal way;
namely, by revealing in and to Israel the real character
of God, and in particular His unapproachable holiness.
For if Israel is to teach the nations the way of holiness,
in which alone they can be blessed, the chosen nation
must itself first be taught holiness by the Holy One.
A lesson here for every one of us! The revelation of
the holiness of God was made, first of all, in the sacrificial
system. The great lesson which it must have
kept before the most obtuse conscience was this, that
"without shedding of blood there is no remission of
sin;" that God therefore must be the Most Holy, and
sin against Him no trifle. It was made, again, in the
precepts of the law. If in some instances these seem
to tolerate evils which we should have expected that
a holy God would at once have swept away, this is
explained by our Lord (Matt. xix. 8) by the fact that
some things were of necessity ordained in view of the
hardness of men's hearts; while, on the other hand,
it is certainly quite plain that the laws of Leviticus
constantly held before the Israelite the absolute holiness
of God as the only standard of perfection.</p>

<p>The holiness of God was further revealed by the
severity of the penalties which were attached to these
Levitical laws. Men often call these harsh, forgetting
that we are certain to underestimate the criminality of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
sin; forgetting that God must, in any case, have rights
over human life which no earthly ruler can have. But
no one will deny that this very severity of the law was
fitted to impress the Israelite, as nothing else could,
with God's absolute intolerance of sin and impurity,
and make him feel that he could not trifle with God,
and hope to sin with impunity.</p>

<p>And yet we must not forget that the law was adapted
no less to reveal the other side of the Divine holiness;
that "the Lord God is merciful and gracious, and of
great kindness." For if the law of Leviticus proclaims
that "without shedding of blood there is no remission,"
with equal clearness it proclaims that with shedding of
blood there can be remission of sin to every believing
penitent.</p>

<p>And this leads to the observation that this law was
further adapted to the training of Israel for its world-mission,
in that to every thoughtful man it must have
suggested a secret of redeeming mercy yet to be revealed.
Every such one must have often said in his heart that
it was "not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats
should take away sin;" and that as a substitute for
human life, when forfeited by sin, more precious blood
than this must be required; even though he might not
have been able to imagine whence God should provide
such a Lamb for an offering. And so it was that the
law was fitted, in the highest degree, to prepare Israel
for the reception of Him to whom all these sacrifices
pointed, the High Priest greater than Aaron, the Lamb
of God which should "take away the sins of the world,"
in whose person and work Israel's mission should at
last receive its fullest realisation.</p>

<p>But the law of Leviticus was not only intended to
prepare Israel for the Messiah by thus awakening a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
sense of sin and need, it was so ordered as to be in
many ways directly typical and prophetic of Christ
and His great redemption, in its future historical
development. Modern rationalism, indeed, denies this;
but it is none the less a fact. According to the Apostle
John (v. 46) our Lord declared that Moses wrote of
Him; and, according to Luke (xxiv. 27), when He
expounded unto the two walking to Emmaus "the
things concerning himself," He began His exposition
with "Moses;" and (ver. 44) repeated what He had
before His resurrection taught them, that all things
"which were written in the law of Moses" concerning
Him, must be fulfilled. And in full accord with
the teaching of the Master taught also His disciples.
The writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews, especially,
argues from this postulate throughout, and also explicitly
affirms the typical character of the ordinances of this
book; declaring, for example, that the Levitical priests
in the tabernacle service served "that which is a copy
of the heavenly things" (Heb. viii. 5); that the blood
with which "the copies of the things in the heavens"
were cleansed, prefigured "better sacrifices than these,"
even the one offering of Him who "put away sin by
the sacrifice of Himself" (Heb. ix. 23-6); and that
the holy times and sabbatic seasons of the law were
"a shadow of the things to come." The fact is familiar,
and one need not multiply illustrations. Many, no
doubt, in the interpretation of these types, have broken
loose from the principles indicated in the New Testament,
and given free rein to an unbridled fancy. But
this only warns us that we the more carefully take
heed to follow the intimations of the New Testament,
and beware of mistaking our own imaginings for the
teaching of the Holy Ghost. Such interpretations may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
bring typology into disrepute, but they cannot nullify
it as a fact which must be recognised in any attempt
to open up the meaning of the book.</p>

<p>Neither is the reality of this typical correspondence
between the Levitical ritual and order and New Testament
facts set aside, even though it is admitted that
we cannot believe that Israel generally could have seen
all in it which the New Testament declares to be there.
For the very same New Testament which declares the
typical correspondence, no less explicitly tells us this
very thing: that many things predicted and prefigured
in the Old Testament, concerning the sufferings and
glory of Christ, were not understood by the very
prophets through whom they were anciently made
known (1 Peter i. 10-12). We have then carefully to
distinguish in our interpretation between the immediate
historical intention of the Levitical ordinances, for the
people of that time, and their typical intention and
meaning; but we are not to imagine with some that
to prove the one, is to disprove the other.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Present-day Use of Leviticus.</span></p>

<p>This very naturally brings us to the answer to the
frequent question: Of what use can the book of
Leviticus be to believers now? We answer, first, that
it is to us, just as much as to ancient Israel, a revelation
of the character of God. It is even a clearer
revelation of God's character to us than to them; for
Christ has come as the Fulfiller, and thus the Interpreter,
of the law. And God has not changed. He is
still exactly what He was when He called to Moses out
of the tent of meeting or spoke to him at Mount Sinai.
He is just as holy as then; just as intolerant of sin as
then; just as merciful to the penitent sinner who presents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
in faith the appointed blood of atonement, as He
was then.</p>

<p>More particularly, Leviticus is of use to us now, as
holding forth, in a singularly vivid manner, the fundamental
conditions of true religion. The Levitical
priesthood and sacrifices are no more, but the spiritual
truth they represented abides and must abide for ever:
namely, that there is for sinful man no citizenship in the
kingdom of God apart from a High Priest and Mediator
with a propitiatory sacrifice for sin. These are days
when many, who would yet be called Christians, belittle
atonement, and deny the necessity of the shedding
of substitutionary blood for our salvation. Such would
reduce, if it were possible, the whole sacrificial ritual
of Leviticus to a symbolic <em>self</em>-offering of the worshipper
to God. But against this stands the constant testimony
of our Lord and His apostles, that it is only through
the shedding of blood <em>not his own</em> that man can have
remission of sin.</p>

<p>But Leviticus presents not only a ritual, but also a
body of civil law for the theocracy. Hence it comes
that the book is of use for to-day, as suggesting
principles which should guide human legislators who
would rule according to the mind of God. Not, indeed,
that the laws in their detail should be adopted in our
modern states; but it is certain that the principles
which underlie those laws are eternal. Social and
governmental questions have come to the front in our
time as never before. The question of the relation of
the civil government to religion, the question of the
rights of labour and of capital, of land-holding, that
which by a suggestive euphemism we call "the social
evil," with its related subjects of marriage and divorce,&mdash;all
these are claiming attention as never before. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
is not one of these questions on which the legislation
of Leviticus does not cast a flood of light, into which
our modern law-makers would do well to come and
walk.</p>

<p>For nothing can be more certain than this; that if
God has indeed once stood to a commonwealth in the
relation of King and political Head, we shall be sure
to discover in His theocratic law upon what principles
infinite righteousness, wisdom, and goodness would
deal with these matters. We shall thus find in Leviticus
that the law which it contains, from beginning to end,
stands in contradiction to that modern democratic
secularism, which would exclude religion from government
and order all national affairs without reference
to the being and government of God; and, by placing
the law of sacrifice at the beginning of the book, it
suggests distinctly enough that the maintenance of right
relation to God is fundamental to good government.</p>

<p>The severity of many of the laws is also instructive
in this connection. The trend of public opinion in
many communities is against capital punishment, as
barbarous and inhuman. We are startled to observe
the place which this has in the Levitical law; which
exhibits a severity far removed indeed from the unrighteous
and undiscriminating severity of the earlier
English law, but no less so from the more undiscriminating
leniency which has taken its place, especially
as regards those crimes in which large numbers
of people are inclined to indulge.</p>

<p>No less instructive to modern law-makers and
political economists is the bearing of the Levitical
legislation on the social question, the relations of rich
and poor, of employer and employed. It is a legislation
which, with admirable impartiality, keeps the poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
man and the rich man equally in view; a body of law
which, if strictly carried out, would have made in Israel
either a plutocracy or a proletariat alike impossible.
All these things will be illustrated in the course of
exposition. Enough has been said to show that those
among us who are sorely perplexed as to what government
should do, at what it should aim in these matters,
may gain help by studying the mind of Divine wisdom
concerning these questions, as set forth in the theocratic
law of Leviticus.</p>

<p>Further, Leviticus is of use to us now as a revelation
of Christ. This follows from what has been already
said concerning the typical character of the law. The
book is thus a treasury of divinely-chosen illustrations
as to the way of a sinner's salvation through the priestly
work of the Son of God, and as to his present and
future position and dignity as a redeemed man.</p>

<p>Finally, and for this same reason, Leviticus is still
of use to us as embodying in type and figure prophecies
of things yet to come, pertaining to Messiah's kingdom.
We must not imagine with some that because many of
its types are long ago fulfilled, therefore all have been
fulfilled. Many, according to the hints of the New
Testament, await their fulfilment in a bright day that is
coming. Some, for instance, of the feasts of the Lord
have been fulfilled; as passover, and the feast of Pentecost.
But how about the day of atonement for the sin
of corporate Israel? We have seen the type of the day
of atonement fulfilled in the entering into heaven of our
great High Priest; but in the type He came out again
to bless the people: has that been fulfilled? Has He
yet proclaimed absolution of sin to guilty Israel? How,
again, about the feast of trumpets, and that of the ingathering
at full harvest? How about the Sabbatic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
year, and that most consummate type of all, the year
of jubilee? History records nothing which could be
held a fulfilment of any of these; and thus Leviticus
bids us look forward to a glorious future yet to come,
when the great redemption shall at last be accomplished,
and "Holiness to Jehovah" shall, as Zechariah
puts it (xiv. 20), be written even "on the bells of the
horses."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<h3><em>SACRIFICE: THE BURNT-OFFERING.</em></h3>

<p class="center">i. 2-4.</p>


<p>The voice of Jehovah which had spoken not long
before from Sinai, now speaks from out "the tent
of meeting." There was a reason for the change. For
Israel had since then entered into covenant with God;
and Moses, as the mediator of the covenant, had sealed
it by sprinkling with blood both the Book of the
Covenant and the people. And therewith they had
professedly taken Jehovah for their God, and He had
taken Israel for His people. In infinite grace, He had
condescended to appoint for Himself a tabernacle or
"tent of meeting," where He might, in a special manner,
dwell among them, and manifest to them His will.
The tabernacle had been made, according to the pattern
shown to Moses in the mount; and it had been now
set up. And so now, He who had before spoken amid
the thunders of flaming, trembling Sinai, speaks from
the hushed silence of "the tent of meeting." The first
words from Sinai had been the holy law, forbidding
sin with threatening of wrath: the first words from
the tent of meeting are words of grace, concerning
fellowship with the Holy One maintained through
sacrifice, and atonement for sin by the shedding of
blood. A contrast this which is itself a Gospel!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>The offerings of which we read in the next seven
chapters are of two kinds, namely, bloody and unbloody
offerings. In the former class were included
the burnt-offering, the peace-offering, the sin-offering,
and the guilt-, or trespass-offering; in the latter, only
the meal-offering. The book begins with the law of
the burnt-offering.</p>

<p>In any exposition of this law of the offerings, it is
imperative that our interpretation shall be determined,
not by any fancy of ours as to what the offerings might
fitly symbolise, nor yet, on the other hand, be limited
by what we may suppose that any Israelite of that day
might have thought regarding them; but by the statements
concerning them which are contained in the law
itself, and in other parts of Holy Scripture, especially
in the New Testament.</p>

<p>First of all, we may observe that in the book itself
the offerings are described by the remarkable expression,
"the bread" or "food of God". Thus, it is commanded
(xxi. 6) that the priests should not defile
themselves, on this ground: "the offerings of the Lord
made by fire, the bread of their God, do they offer."
It was an ancient heathen notion that in sacrifice, food
was provided for the Deity in order thus to show
Him honour. And, doubtless, in Israel, ever prone to
idolatry, there were many who rose no higher than
this gross conception of the meaning of such words.
Thus, in Psalm l. 8-15, God sharply rebukes Israel for
so unworthy thoughts of Himself, using language at
the same time which teaches the spiritual meaning of
the sacrifice, regarded as the "food," or "bread," of
God: "I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices; and
thy burnt-offerings are continually before Me.... I
will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he-goats out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
of thy stalls.... If I were hungry, I would not tell
thee; for the world is Mine, and the fulness thereof.
Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of
goats? Offer unto God the sacrifice of <em>thanksgiving</em>;
and <em>pay thy vows</em> unto the Most High; and call upon
Me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee and thou
shalt glorify Me."</p>

<p>Of which language the plain teaching is this. If the
sacrifices are called in the law "the bread of God,"
God asks not this bread from Israel in any material
sense, or for any material need. He asks that which
the offerings symbolise; thanksgiving, loyal fulfilment
of covenant engagements to Him, and that loving trust
which will call on Him in the day of trouble. Even
so! Gratitude, loyalty, trust! this is the "food of
God," this the "bread" which He desires that we
should offer, the bread which those Levitical sacrifices
symbolised. For even as man, when hungry, craves
food, and cannot be satisfied without it, so God, who
is Himself Love, desires our love, and delights in seeing
its expression in all those offices of self-forgetting and
self-sacrificing service in which love manifests itself.
This is to God even as is food to us. Love cannot be
satisfied except with love returned; and we may say,
with deepest humility and reverence, the God of love
cannot be satisfied without love returned. Hence it
is that the sacrifices, which in various ways symbolise
the self-offering of love and the fellowship of love, are
called by the Holy Ghost "the food," or "bread of
God."</p>

<p>And yet we must, on no account, hasten to the
conclusion, as many do, that therefore the Levitical
sacrifices were <em>only</em> intended to express and symbolise
the self-offering of the worshipper, and that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
exhausts their significance. On the contrary, the need
of infinite Love for this "bread of God" cannot be
adequately met and satisfied by the self-offering of any
creature, and, least of all, by the self-offering of a sinful
creature, whose very sin lies just in this, that he has
fallen away from perfect love. The symbolism of the
sacrifice as "the food of God," therefore, by this very
phrase points toward the self-offering in love of the
eternal Son to the Father, and in behalf of sinners,
for the Father's sake. It was the sacrifice on Calvary
which first became, in innermost reality, that "bread of
God," which the ancient sacrifices were only in symbol.
It was this, not regarded as satisfying Divine justice
(though it did this), but as satisfying the Divine love;
because it was the supreme expression of the perfect
love of the incarnate Son of God to the Father, in His
becoming "obedient unto death, even the death of the
cross."</p>

<p>And now, keeping all this in view, we may venture
to say even more than at first as to the meaning
of this phrase, "the bread of God," applied to these
offerings by fire. For just as the free activity of man
is only sustained in virtue of and by means of the food
which he eats, so also the love of the God of love is
only sustained in free activity toward man through the
self-offering to the Father of the Son, in that atoning
sacrifice which He offered on the cross, and in the
ceaseless service of that exalted life which, risen from
the dead, Christ now lives unto God for ever. Thus
already, this expression, so strange to our ears at first,
as descriptive of Jehovah's offerings made by fire,
points to the person and work of the adorable Redeemer
as its only sufficient explication.</p>

<p>But, again, we find another expression, xvii. 11,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
which is of no less fundamental consequence for the
interpretation of the bloody offerings of Leviticus. In
connection with the prohibition of blood for food,
and as a reason for that prohibition, it is said: "The
life of the flesh is in the blood; and I have given it
to you upon the altar to make atonement for your
souls; for it is the blood that maketh atonement,"&mdash;mark
the expression; not, as in the received version,
"<em>for</em> the soul," which were mere tautology, and gives
a sense which the Hebrew cannot have, but, as the
Revised Version has it,&mdash;"by reason of the life," or
"soul" (marg.). Hence, wherever in this law we
read of a sprinkling of blood upon the altar, this must
be held fast as its meaning, whether it be formally
mentioned or not; namely, atonement made for sinful
man through the life of an innocent victim poured
out in the blood. There may be, and often are, other
ideas, as we shall see, connected with the offering,
but this is always present. To argue, then, with so
many in modern times, that because, not the idea of an
atonement, but that of a sacrificial meal given by the
worshipper to God, is the dominant conception in the
sacrifices of the ancient nations, therefore we cannot
admit the idea of atonement and expiation to have
been intended in these Levitical sacrifices, is simply to
deny, not only the New Testament interpretation of
them, but the no less express testimony of the record
itself.</p>

<p>But it is, manifestly, in the nature of the case
"impossible that the blood of bulls and of goats should
take away sins." Hence, we are again, by this phrase
also, constrained to look beyond this Levitical shedding
of sacrificial blood, for some antitype of which the
innocent victims slain at that altar were types; one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
who, by the shedding of his blood, should do that in
reality, which at the door of the tent of meeting was
done in symbol and shadow.</p>

<p>What the New Testament teaches on this point is
known to every one. Christ Jesus was the Antitype, to
whose all-sufficient sacrifice each insufficient sacrifice
of every Levitical victim pointed. John the Baptist
struck the key-note of all New Testament teaching in
this matter, when, beholding Jesus, he cried (John i.
29), "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the
sin of the world." Jesus Christ declared the same
thought again and again, as in His words at the
sacramental Supper: "This is My blood of the new
covenant, which is shed for many for the remission of
sins." Paul expressed the same thought, when he said
(Eph. v. 2) that Christ "gave Himself up for us, an
offering and a sacrifice to God, for an odour of a sweet
smell;" and that "our redemption, the forgiveness of
our trespasses," is "through His blood" (Eph. i. 7).
And Peter also, speaking in Levitical language, teaches
that we "were redeemed ... with precious blood, as of
a lamb without blemish and without spot, even the blood
of Christ;" to which he adds the suggestive words, of
which this whole Levitical ritual is the most striking
illustration, that Christ, although "manifested at the
end of the times," "was foreknown" as the Lamb of
God "before the foundation of the world" (1 Peter i.
18-20). John, in like manner, speaks in the language
of Leviticus concerning Christ, when he declares (1
John i. 7) that "the blood of Jesus ... cleanseth us
from all sin;" and even in the Apocalypse, which is
the Gospel of Christ glorified, He is still brought
before us as a Lamb that had been slain, and who has
thus "purchased with His blood men of every tribe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and tongue, and people, and nation," "to be unto our
God a kingdom and priests" (Rev. v. 6, 9, 10).</p>

<p>In this clear light of the New Testament, one can
see how meagre also is the view of some who would
see in these Levitical sacrifices nothing more than
fines assessed upon the guilty, as theocratic penalties.
Leviticus itself should have taught such better than
that. For, as we have seen, the virtue of the bloody
offerings is made to consist in this, that "the life of
the flesh is in the blood;" and we are told that "the
blood makes atonement for the soul," not in virtue of
the monetary value of the victim, in a commercial way,
but "by reason of the life" that is in the blood, and
is therewith poured out before Jehovah on the altar,&mdash;the
life of an innocent victim in the stead of the life of
the sinful man.</p>

<p>No less inadequate, if we are to let ourselves be
guided either by the Levitical or the New Testament
teaching, is the view that the offerings only symbolised
the self-offering of the worshipper. We do not deny,
indeed, that the sacrifice&mdash;of the burnt-offering, for
example&mdash;may have fitly represented, and often really
expressed, the self-consecration of the offerer. But, in
the light of the New Testament, this can never be held
to have been the sole, or even the chief, reason in the
mind of God for directing these outpourings of sacrificial
blood upon the altar.</p>

<p>We must insist, then, on this, as essential to the
right interpretation of this law of the offerings, that
every one of these bloody offerings of Leviticus typified,
and was intended to typify, our Saviour, Jesus Christ.
The burnt-offering represented Christ; the peace-offering,
Christ; the sin-offering, Christ; the guilt-, or
trespass-offering, Christ. Moreover, since each of these,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
as intended especially to shadow forth some particular
aspect of Christ's work, differed in some respects from
all the others, while yet in all alike a victim's blood was
shed upon the altar, we are by this reminded that in our
Lord's redemptive work the most central and essential
thing is this, that, as He Himself said (Matt. xx. 28),
He "came to give His life a ransom for many."</p>

<p>Keeping this guiding thought steadily before us, it
is now our work to discover, if we may, what special
aspect of the one great sacrifice of Christ each of these
offerings was intended especially to represent.</p>

<p>Only, by way of caution, it needs to be added that
we are not to imagine that every minute circumstance
pertaining to each sacrifice, in all its varieties, must
have been intended to point to some correspondent
feature of Christ's person or work. On the contrary,
we shall frequently see reason to believe that the
whole purpose of one or another direction of the ritual
is to be found in the conditions, circumstances, or immediate
intention of the offering. Thus, to illustrate,
when a profound interpreter suggests that the reason
for the command that the victim should be slain on the
north side of the altar, is to be found in the fact that
the north, as the side of shadow, signifies the gloom
and joylessness of the sacrificial act, we are inclined
rather to see sufficient reason for the prescription in
the fact that the other three sides were already in a
manner occupied: the east, as the place of ashes; the
south, as fronting the entrance; and the west, as facing
the tent of meeting and the brazen laver.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Ritual of the Burnt-offering.</span></p>

<p>In the law of the offerings, that of the burnt-offering
comes first, though in the order of the ritual it was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
first, but second, following the sin-offering. In this
order of mention we need, however, seek no mystic
meaning. The burnt-offering was very naturally mentioned
first, as being the most ancient, and also in the
most constant and familiar use. We read of burnt-offerings
as offered by Noah and Abraham; and of
peace-offerings, too, in early times; while the sin-offering
and the guilt-offering, in Leviticus treated last,
were now ordered for the first time. So also the burnt-offering
was still, by Divine ordinance, to be the most
common. No day could pass in the tabernacle without
the offering of these. Indeed, except on the great day
of atonement for the nation, in the ritual for which, the
sin-offering was the central act, the burnt-offering was
the most important sacrifice on all the great feast-days.</p>

<p>The first law, which applies to bloody offerings in
general, was this: that the victim shall be "of the cattle,
even of the herd and of the flock" (ver. 2); to which is
added, in the latter part of the chapter (ver. 14), the turtle-dove
or young pigeon. The carnivora are all excluded;
for these, which live by the death of others, could never
typify Him who should come to give life. And among
others, only clean beasts could be taken. Israel must
not offer as "the food of God" that which they might
not eat for their own food; nor could that which was
held unclean be taken as a type of the Holy Victim of
the future. And, even among clean animals, a further
selection is made. Only domestic animals were allowed;
not even a clean animal was permitted, if it were taken
in hunting. For it was fitting that one should offer
to God that which had become endeared to the owner
as having cost the most of care and labour in its
bringing up. For this, also, we can easily see another
reason in the Antitype. Nothing was to mark Him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
more than this: that He should be subject and obey,
and that not of constraint, as the unwilling captive of
the chase, but freely and unresistingly.</p>

<p>And now follow the special directions for the burnt-offering.
The Hebrew word so rendered means, literally,
"that which ascends". It thus precisely describes
the burnt-offering in its most distinctive characteristic.
Of the other offerings, a part was burned, but a part
was eaten; in some instances, even by the offerer
himself. But in the burnt-offering all ascends to God
in flame and smoke. For the creature is reserved
nothing whatever.</p>

<p>The first specification in the law of the burnt-offering
is this: "If his oblation be a burnt-offering of the
herd, he shall offer it a male without blemish" (ver. 3).
It must be a "male," as the stronger, the type of its
kind; and "without blemish," that is, ideally perfect.</p>

<p>The reasons for this law are manifest. The Israelite
was thereby taught that God claims the best that we
have. They needed this lesson, as many among us do
still. At a later day, we find God rebuking them by
Malachi (i. 6, 13), with indignant severity, for their
neglect of this law: "A son honoureth his father: ...
if then I be a Father, where is My honour?...
Ye have brought that which was taken by violence,
and the lame, and the sick; ... should I accept this
of your hand? saith the Lord." And as pointing to
our Lord, the command was no less fitting. Thus, as
in other sacrifices, it was foreshadowed that the great
Burnt-offering of the future would be the one Man
without blemish, the absolutely perfect Exemplar of
what manhood should be, but is not.</p>

<p>And this brings us now to the ritual of the offering.
In the ritual of the various bloody offerings we find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
six parts. These are: (1) the Presentation; (2) the
Laying on of the Hand; (3) the Killing of the Victim;
in which three the ritual was the same for all kinds of
offerings. The remaining three are: (4) the Sprinkling
of Blood; (5) the Burning; (6) the Sacrificial Meal.
In these, differences appear in the various sacrifices,
which give each its distinctive character; and, in the
burnt-offering, the sacrificial meal is omitted,&mdash;the
whole is burnt upon the altar.</p>

<p>First is given the law concerning</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Presentation of the Victim.</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He shall offer it at the door of the tent of meeting, that he may
be accepted before the Lord" (ver. 3).</p></blockquote>

<p>In this it was ordered, first, that the offerer should
bring the victim himself. There were parts of the
ceremony in which the priest acted for him; but this
he must do for himself. Even so, he who will have
the saving benefit of Christ's sacrifice must himself
bring this Christ before the Lord. As by so doing,
the Israelite signified his acceptance of God's gracious
arrangements concerning sacrifice, so do we, bringing
Christ in our act of faith before the Lord, express our
acceptance of God's arrangement on our behalf; our
readiness and sincere desire to make use of Christ, who
is appointed for us. And this no man can do for
another.</p>

<p>And the offering must be presented for a certain
purpose; namely, "that he may be accepted before the
Lord;"<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and that, as the context tells us, not because of
a present made to God, but through an atoning sacrifice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
And so now it is not enough that a man make much
of Christ, and mention Him in terms of praise before
the Lord, as the One whom He would imitate and seek
to serve. He must in his act of faith bring this Christ
before the Lord, in such wise as to secure thus his
personal acceptance through the blood of the Holy
Victim.</p>

<p>And, finally, the <em>place</em> of presentation is prescribed.
It must be "at the door of the tent of meeting." It
is easy to see the original reason for this. For, as we
learn from other Scriptures, the Israelites were ever
prone to idolatry, and that especially at places other
than the appointed temple or tent of meeting, in the
fields and on high places. Hence the immediate purpose
of this order concerning the place, was to separate
the worship of God from the worship of false gods.
There is now, indeed, no law concerning the place
where we may present the great Sacrifice before God.
At home, in the closet, in the church, on the street,
wherever we will, we may present this Christ in our
behalf and stead as a Holy Victim before God. And
yet the principle which underlies this ordinance of
place is no less applicable in this age than then. For
it is a prohibition of all self-will in worship. It was
not enough that an Israelite should have the prescribed
victim; it is not enough that we present the Christ of
God in faith, or what we think to be faith. But we
must make no terms or conditions as to the mode or
condition of the presentation, other than God appoints.
And the command was also a command of publicity.
The Israelite was therein commanded to confess publicly,
and thus attest, his faith in Jehovah, even as God will
now have us all make our confession of Christ a public
thing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>The second act of the ceremonial was</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Laying on of the Hand.</span></p>

<p>It was ordered:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He shall lay his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it
shall be accepted for him, to make atonement for him" (ver. 4).</p></blockquote>

<p>The laying on of the hand was not, as some have
maintained, a mere declaration of the offerer's property
in that which he offered, as showing his right to give
it to God. If this were true, we should find the ceremony
also in the bloodless offerings; where the cakes
of corn were no less the property of the offerer than
the bullock or sheep of the burnt-offering. But the
ceremony was confined to these bloody offerings.</p>

<p>It is nearer the truth when others say that this was
an act of designation. It is a fact that the ceremony
of the laying on of hands in Scripture usage does
indicate a designation of a person or thing, as to some
office or service. In this book (xxiv. 14), the witnesses
are directed to lay their hands upon the blasphemer,
thereby appointing him to death. Moses is
said to have laid his hands on Joshua, thus designating
him in a formal way as his successor; and, in the New
Testament, Paul and Barnabas are set apart to the
ministry by the laying on of hands. But, in all these
cases, the ceremony symbolised more than mere designation;
namely, a transfer or communication of something
invisible, in connection with this visible act.
Thus, in the New Testament the laying on of hands
always denotes the communication of the Holy Ghost,
either as an enduement for office, or for bodily healing.
The laying of the hands of Moses on Joshua, in like
manner, signified the transfer to him of the gifts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
office, and authority of Moses. Even in the case of
the execution of the blaspheming son of Shelomith, the
laying on of the hands of the witnesses had the same
significance. They thereby designated him to death,
no doubt; but therewith thus symbolically transferred
to the criminal the responsibility for his own death.</p>

<p>From the analogy of these cases we should expect
to find evidence of an ideal transference of somewhat
from the offerer to the victim here. And the context
does not leave the matter doubtful. It is added (ver. 4),
"It shall be accepted for him, to make atonement for
him." Hence it appears that while, indeed, the offerer,
by this laying on of his hand, did dedicate the victim
to death, the act meant more than this. It symbolised
a transfer, according to God's merciful provision, of an
obligation to suffer for sin, from the offerer to the
innocent victim. Henceforth, the victim stood in the
offerer's place, and was dealt with accordingly.</p>

<p>This is well illustrated by the account which is given
(Numb. viii.) of the formal substitution of the Levites
in the place of all the first-born of Israel, for special
service unto God. We read that the Levites were
presented before the Lord; and that the children of
Israel then laid their hands upon the heads of the
Levites, who were thus, we are told, "offered as an
offering unto the Lord," and were thenceforth regarded
and treated as substitutes for the first-born of all
Israel. Thus the obligation to certain special service
was symbolically transferred, as the context tells us,
from the first-born to the Levites; and this transfer
of obligation from all the tribes to the single tribe
of Levi was visibly represented by the laying on of
hands. And just so here: the laying on of the hand
designated, certainly, the victim to death; but it did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
this, in that it was the symbol of a transfer of
obligation.</p>

<p>This view of the ceremony is decisively confirmed
by the ritual of the great day of atonement. In the
sin-offering of that day, in which the conception of
expiation by blood received its fullest symbolic expression,
it was ordered (xvi. 21) that Aaron should lay
his hands on the head of one of the goats of the sin-offering,
and "confess over him all the iniquities of
the children of Israel." Thereupon the iniquity of the
nation was regarded as symbolically transferred from
Israel to the goat; for it is added, "and the goat shall
bear upon him all their iniquities unto a solitary land."
So, while in this ritual for the burnt-offering there is
no mention of such confession, we have every reason
to believe the uniform Rabbinical tradition, that it was
the custom to make also upon the head of the victim
for the burnt-offering a solemn confession of sin, for
which they give the form to be used.</p>

<p>Such then was the significance of the laying on of
hands. But the ceremony meant even more than this.
For the Hebrew verb which is always used for this,
as the Rabbis point out, does not merely mean to lay
the hand upon, but so to lay the hand as to rest or
lean heavily upon the victim. This force of the word
is well illustrated from a passage where it occurs, in
Psalm lxxxviii. 7, "Thy wrath lieth hard upon me." The
ceremony, therefore, significantly represented the offerer
as resting or relying on the victim to procure that from
God for which he presented him, namely, atonement
and acceptance.</p>

<p>This part of the ceremonial of this and other sacrifices
was thus full of spiritual import and typical meaning.
By this laying on of the hand to designate the victim as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
a sacrifice, the offerer implied, and probably expressed,
a confession of personal sin and demerit; as done
"before Jehovah," it implied also his acceptance of
God's penal judgment against his sin. It implied,
moreover, in that the offering was made according to
an arrangement ordained by God, that the offerer also
thankfully accepted God's merciful provision for atonement,
by which the obligation to suffer for sin was
transferred from himself, the guilty sinner, to the
sacrificial victim. And, finally, in that the offerer was
directed so to lay his hand as to rest upon the victim,
it was most expressively symbolised that he, the sinful
Israelite, rested and depended on this sacrifice as the
atonement for his sin, his divinely appointed substitute
in penal death.</p>

<p>What could more perfectly set forth the way in
which we are for our salvation to make use of the
Lamb of God as slain for us? By faith, we lay the
hand upon His head. In this, we do frankly and
penitently own the sins for which, as the great Burnt-sacrifice,
the Christ of God was offered; we also, in
humility and self-abasement, thus accept the judgment
of God against ourselves, that because of sin we deserve
to be cast out from Him eternally; while, at the
same time, we most thankfully accept this Christ as
"the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the
world," and therefore our sins also, if we will but thus
make use of Him; and so lean and rest with all the
burden of our sin on Him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For the Israelite who should thus lay his hand upon
the head of the sacrificial victim a promise follows.
"It shall be accepted for him, to make atonement for
him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>In this word "atonement" we are introduced to one
of the key-words of Leviticus, as indeed of the whole
Scripture. The Hebrew radical originally means "to
cover," and is used once (Gen. vi. 14) in this purely
physical sense. But, commonly, as here, it means "to
cover" in a spiritual sense, that is, to cover the sinful
person from the sight of the Holy God, who is "of
purer eyes than to behold evil." Hence, it is commonly
rendered "to atone," or "to make atonement;" also,
"to reconcile," or "to make reconciliation." The
thought is this: that between the sinner and the Holy
One comes now the guiltless victim; so that the eye of
God looks not upon the sinner, but on the offered substitute;
and in that the blood of the substituted victim
is offered before God for the sinner, atonement is made
for sin, and the Most Holy One is satisfied.</p>

<p>And when the believing Israelite should lay his hand
with confession of sin upon the appointed victim, it was
graciously promised: "It shall be accepted for him, to
make atonement for him." And just so now, whenever
any guilty sinner, fearing the deserved wrath of
God because of his sin, especially because of his lack
of that full consecration which the burnt-sacrifice set
forth, lays his hand in faith upon the great Burnt-offering
of Calvary, the blessing is the same. For in
the light of the cross, this Old Testament word becomes
now a sweet New Testament promise: "When thou
shalt rest with the hand of faith upon this Lamb of
God, He shall be accepted for thee, to make atonement
for thee."</p>

<p>This is most beautifully expressed in an ancient
"Order for the Visitation of the Sick," attributed to
Anselm of Canterbury, in which it is written:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The minister shall say to the sick man: Dost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
thou believe that thou canst not be saved but by the
death of Christ? The sick man answereth, Yes. Then
let it be said unto him: Go to, then, and whilst thy
soul abideth in thee, put all thy confidence in this
death alone; place thy trust in no other thing; commit
thyself wholly to this death; cover thyself wholly with
this alone.... And if God would judge thee, say:
Lord! I place the death of our Lord Jesus Christ
between me and Thy judgment; otherwise I will not
contend or enter into judgment with Thee.</p>

<p>"And if He shall say unto thee that thou art a
sinner, say: I place the death of our Lord Jesus Christ
between me and my sins. If He shall say unto thee,
that thou hast deserved damnation, say: Lord! I put
the death of our Lord Jesus Christ between Thee and
all my sins; and I offer His merits for my own, which
I should have, and have not."</p>

<p>And whosoever of us can thus speak, to him the
promise speaks from out the shadows of the tent
of meeting: "This Christ, the Lamb of God, the true
Burnt-offering, shall be accepted for thee, to make
atonement for thee!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<h3><em>THE BURNT-OFFERING (CONCLUDED).</em></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lev.</span> i. 5-17; vi. 8-13.</p>


<p>After the laying on of the hand, the next sacrificial
act was&mdash;</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Killing of the Victim.</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And he shall kill the bullock before the Lord" (ver. 5).</p></blockquote>

<p>In the light of what has been already said, the significance
of this killing, in a typical way, will be quite
clear. For with the first sin, and again and again
thereafter, God had denounced death as the penalty
of sin. But here is a sinner who, in accord with a
Divine command, brings before God a sacrificial victim,
on whose head he lays his hand, on which he thus
rests as he confesses his sins, and gives over the
innocent victim to die instead of himself. Thus each
of these sacrificial deaths, whether in the burnt-offering,
the peace-offering, or the sin-offering, brings ever before
us the death in the sinner's stead of that one Holy
Victim who suffered for us, "the just for the unjust,"
and thus laid down His life, in accord with His own
previously declared intention, "as a ransom for many."</p>

<p>In the sacrifices made by and for individuals, the
victim was killed, except in the case of the turtle-dove
or pigeon, by the offerer himself; but, very naturally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
in the case of the national and public offerings, it was
killed by the priest. As, in this latter case, it was
impossible that all individual Israelites should unite in
killing the victim, it is plain that the priest herein acted
as the representative of the nation. Hence we may
properly say that the fundamental thought of the ritual
was this, that the victim should be killed by the offerer
himself.</p>

<p>And by this ordinance we may well be reminded, first,
how Israel,&mdash;for whose sake as a nation the antitypical
Sacrifice was offered,&mdash;Israel itself became the executioner
of the Victim; and, beyond that, how, in a deeper
sense, every sinner must regard himself as truly causal
of the Saviour's death, in that, as is often truly said,
our sins nailed Christ to His cross. But whether such
a reference were intended in this law of the offering
or not, the great, significant, outstanding fact remains,
that as soon as the offerer, by his laying on of the hand,
signified the transfer of the personal obligation to die
for sin from himself to the sacrificial victim, then came at
once upon that victim the penalty denounced against sin.</p>

<p>And the added words, "before the Lord," cast further
light upon this, in that they remind us that the killing
of the victim had reference to Jehovah, whose holy law
the offerer, failing of that perfect consecration which
the burnt-offering symbolised, had failed to glorify and
honour.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Sprinkling of Blood.</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And Aaron's sons, the priests, shall present the blood, and sprinkle
the blood round about upon the altar that is at the door of the tent of
meeting" (ver. 5).</p></blockquote>

<p>And now follows the fourth act in the ceremonial,
the Sprinkling of the Blood. The offerer's part is now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
done, and herewith the work of the priest begins.
Even so must we, having laid the hand of faith upon
the head of the substituted Lamb of God, now leave
it to the heavenly Priest to act in our behalf with God.</p>

<p>The directions to the priest as to the use of the blood
vary in the different offerings, according as the design
is to give greater or less prominence to the idea of
expiation. In the sin-offering this has the foremost
place. But in the burnt-offering, as also in the peace-offering,
although the conception of atonement by blood
was not absent, it was not the dominant conception of
the sacrifice. Hence, while the sprinkling of blood by
the priest could in no wise be omitted, it took in this
case a subordinate place in the ritual. It was to be
sprinkled only on the sides of the altar of burnt-offering
which stood in the outer court. We read (ver. 5):
"Aaron's sons, the priests, shall present the blood,
and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that
is at the door of the tent of meeting."</p>

<p>It was in this sprinkling of the blood that the atoning
work was completed. The altar had been appointed
as a place of Jehovah's special presence; it had been
designated as a place where God would come unto man
to bless him. Thus, to present and sprinkle the blood
upon the altar was symbolically to present the blood
unto God. And the blood represented life,&mdash;the life
of an innocent victim atoning for the sinner, because
rendered up in the stead of his life. And the <em>priests</em>
were to sprinkle the blood. So, while to bring and
present the sacrifice of Christ, to lay the hand of faith
upon His head, is our part, with this our duty ends.
To sprinkle the blood, to use the blood God-ward for
the remission of sin, this is the work alone of our
heavenly Priest. We are then to leave that with Him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Reserving a fuller exposition of the meaning of this
sprinkling of blood for the exposition of the sin-offering,
in which it was the central act of the ritual,
we pass on now to the burning of the sacrifice, which
in this offering marked the culmination of its special
symbolism.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Sacrificial Burning.</span></p>

<p class="center">i. 6-9, 12, 13, 17.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into its pieces.
And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay
wood in order upon the fire: and Aaron's sons, the priests, shall lay
the pieces, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the
fire which is upon the altar: but its inwards and its legs shall he
wash with water: and the priest shall burn the whole on the altar,
for a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the
Lord.... And he shall cut it into its pieces, with its head and its fat:
and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire
which is upon the altar: but the inwards and the legs shall he wash
with water: and the priest shall offer the whole, and burn it upon
the altar: it is a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet
savour unto the Lord.... And he shall rend it by the wings thereof,
but shall not divide it asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the
altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burnt offering,
an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the Lord."</p></blockquote>

<p>It was the distinguishing peculiarity of the burnt-offering,
from which it takes its name, that in every
case the whole of it was burned, and thus ascended
heavenward in the fire and smoke of the altar. The
place of the burning, in this and other sacrifices, is
significant. The flesh of the sin-offering, when not
eaten, was to be burned in a clean place without the
camp. But it was the law of the burnt-offering that
it should be wholly consumed upon the holy altar at
the door of the tent of meeting. In the directions for
the burning we need seek for no occult meaning; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
most of them are evidently intended simply as means
to the end; namely, the consumption of the offering
with the utmost readiness, ease, and completeness.
Hence it must be flayed and cut into its pieces, and
carefully arranged upon the wood. The inwards and
the legs must be washed with water, that into the
offering, as to be offered to the Holy One, might come
nothing extraneous, nothing corrupt and unclean.</p>

<p>In vv. 10-13 and 14-17 provision is made for the
offering of different victims, of the flock, or of the
fowls. The reason for this permitted variation, although
not mentioned here, was doubtless the same which is
given for a similar permission in chap. v. 7, where it
is ordered that if the offerer's means suffice not for
a certain offering, he may bring one of less value.
Poverty shall be no plea for not bringing a burnt-sacrifice;
to the Israelite of that time it thus set
forth the truth, that "if there first be a willing heart,
it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not
according to that he hath not."</p>

<p>The variations in the prescriptions regarding the
different victims to be used in the sacrifice are but
slight. The bird having been killed by the priest (why
this change it is not easy to see), its crop, with its
contents of food unassimilated, and therefore not a part
of the bird, as also the feathers, was to be cast away.
It was not to be divided, like the bullock, and the sheep
or goat, simply because, with so small a creature, it was
not necessary to the speedy and entire combustion of
the offering. In each case alike, the declaration is
made that the sacrifice, thus offered and wholly burnt
upon the altar, is "an offering made by fire, of a sweet
savour unto the Lord."</p>

<p>And now a question comes before us, the answer to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
which is vital to the right understanding of the burnt-offering,
whether in its original or typical import.
What was the significance of the burning? It has
been very often answered that the consumption of the
victim by fire symbolised the consuming wrath of
Jehovah, utterly destroying the victim which represented
the sinful person of the offerer. And, observing
that the burning followed the killing and shedding of
blood, some have even gone so far as to say that the
burning typified the eternal fire of hell! But when we
remember that, without doubt, the sacrificial victim in
all the Levitical offerings was a type of our blessed
Lord, we may well agree with one who justly calls this
interpretation "hideous." And yet many, who have
shrunk from this, have yet in so far held to this conception
of the symbolic meaning of the burning as to
insist that it must at least have typified those fiery
sufferings in which our Lord offered up His soul for
sin. They remind us how often, in the Scripture, fire
stands as the symbol of the consuming wrath of God
against sin, and hence argue that this may justly be
taken here as the symbolic meaning of the burning of
the victim on the altar.</p>

<p>But this interpretation is nevertheless, in every form,
to be rejected. As regards the use of fire as a symbol
in Holy Scripture, while it is true that it often represents
the punitive wrath of God, it is equally certain
that it has not always this meaning. Quite as often
it is the symbol of God's purifying energy and might.
Fire was not the symbol of Jehovah's vengeance in the
burning bush. When the Lord is represented as sitting
"as a refiner and a purifier of silver," surely the thought
is not of vengeance, but of purifying mercy. We
should rather say that fire, in Scripture usage, is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
symbol of the intense energy of the Divine nature,
which continually acts upon every person and on every
thing, according to the nature of each person or thing;
here conserving, there destroying; now cleansing, now
consuming. The same fire which burns the wood, hay,
and stubble, purifies the gold and the silver.</p>

<p>Hence, while it is quite true that fire often typifies
the wrath of God punishing sin, it is certain that it
cannot always symbolise this, not even in the sacrificial
ritual. For in the meal-offering of chap. ii. it is impossible
that the thought of expiation should enter
since no life is offered and no blood is shed; yet this
also is presented unto God in fire. The fire then in this
case must mean something else than the Divine wrath,
and presumably must mean one thing in all the sacrifices.
And that not even in the burnt-offering can the
burning of the sacrifice symbolise the consuming wrath
of God, becomes plain, when we observe that, according
to the uniform teaching of the sacrificial ritual,
atonement is already fully accomplished, prior to the
burning, in the sprinkling of the blood. That the
burning, which follows the atonement, should have any
reference to Christ's expiatory sufferings, is thus quite
impossible.</p>

<p>We must hold, therefore, that the burning can only
mean in the burnt-offering that which alone it can
signify in the meal-offering; namely, the ascending of
the offering in consecration to God, on the one hand;
and, on the other, God's gracious acceptance and appropriation
of the offering. This was impressively set
forth in the case of the burnt-offering presented when
the tabernacle service was inaugurated; when, we are
told (ix. 24), the fire which consumed it came forth
from before Jehovah, lighted by no human hand, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
was thus a visible representation of God accepting and
appropriating the offering to Himself.</p>

<p>The symbolism of the burning thus understood, we
can now perceive what must have been the special
meaning of this sacrifice. As regarded by the believing
Israelite of those days, not yet discerning clearly the
deeper truth it shadowed forth as to the great Burnt-sacrifice
of the future, it must have symbolically taught
him that complete consecration unto God is essential to
right worship. There were sacrifices having a different
special import, in which, while a part was burnt, the
offerer might even himself join in eating the remaining
part, taking that for his own use. But, in the burnt-offering,
nothing was for himself: all was for God; and
in the fire of the altar God took the whole in such
a way that the offering for ever passed beyond the
offerer's recall. In so far as the offerer entered into
this conception, and his inward experience corresponded
to this outward rite, it was for him an act of worship.</p>

<p>But to the thoughtful worshipper, one would think,
it must sometimes have occurred that, after all, it was
not himself or his gift that thus ascended in full consecration
to God, but a victim appointed by God to
represent him in death on the altar. And thus it was
that, whether understood or not, the offering in its very
nature pointed to a Victim of the future, in whose person
and work, as the One only fully-consecrated Man, the
burnt-offering should receive its full explication. And
this brings us to the question, What aspect of the person
and work of our Lord was herein specially typified?
It cannot be the resultant fellowship with God, as in
the peace-offering; for the sacrificial feast which set
this forth was in this case wanting. Neither can it be
expiation for sin; for although this is expressly represented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
here, yet it is not the chief thing. The principal
thing, in the burnt-offering, was the burning, the
complete consumption of the victim in the sacrificial
fire. Hence what is represented chiefly here, is not
so much Christ representing His people in atoning
death, as Christ representing His people in perfect
consecration and entire self-surrender unto God; in
a word, in perfect obedience.</p>

<p>Of these two things, the atoning death and the
representative obedience, we think, and with reason,
much of the former; but most Christians, though
without reason, think less of the latter. And yet how
much is made of this aspect of our Lord's work in the
Gospels! The first words which we hear from His
lips are to this effect, when, at twelve years of age,
He asked His mother (Luke ii. 49), "Wist ye not that
I must be (lit.) in the things of My Father?" and
after His official work began in the first cleansing of
the temple, this manifestation of His character was
such as to remind His disciples that it was written,
"The zeal of Thy house shall eat me up";&mdash;phraseology
which brings the burnt-offering at once to mind.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> And
His constant testimony concerning Himself, to which
His whole life bare witness, was in such words as
these: "I came down from heaven, not to do My own
will, but the will of Him that sent Me." In particular,
He especially regarded His atoning work in this aspect.
In the parable of the Good Shepherd (John x. 1-18),
for example, after telling us that because of His laying
down His life for the sheep the Father loved Him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
and that to this end He had received from the Father
authority to lay down His life for the sheep, He then
adds as the reason of this: "This commandment have
I received from My Father." And so elsewhere (John
xii. 49, 50) He says of all His words, as of all His
works: "The Father hath given Me a commandment,
what I should say, and what I should speak; ...
the things therefore which I speak, even as the Father
hath said unto Me, so I speak." And when at last His
earthly work approaches its close, and we see Him in
the agony of Gethsemane, there He appears, above all,
as the perfectly consecrated One, offering Himself, body,
soul, and spirit, as a whole burnt-offering unto God,
in those never-to-be-forgotten words (Matt. xxvi. 39),
"Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass away from
Me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as Thou wilt."
And, if any more proof were needed, we have it in
that inspired exposition (Heb. x. 5-10) of Psalm xl.
6-8 wherein it is taught that this perfect obedience
of Christ, in full consecration, was indeed the very
thing which the Holy Ghost foresignified in the whole
burnt-offerings of the law: "When He cometh into
the world, He saith, Sacrifice and offering Thou
wouldest not, but a body didst Thou prepare for Me;
in whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin Thou
hadst no pleasure: then said I, Lo, I am come (in
the roll of the book it is written of Me) to do Thy will,
O God."</p>

<p>Thus the burnt-offering brings before us in type, for
our faith, Christ as our Saviour in virtue of His being
the One wholly surrendered to the will of the Father.
Nor does this exclude, but rather defines, the conception
of Christ as our substitute and representative.
For He said that it was for our sakes that He "sanctified,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
or "consecrated" Himself (John xvii. 19); and
while the New Testament represents Him as saving us
by His death as an expiation for sin, it no less explicitly
holds Him forth to us as having obeyed in our behalf,
declaring (Rom. v. 19) that it is "by the obedience of
the One Man" that "many are made righteous." And,
elsewhere, the same Apostle represents the incomparable
moral value of the atoning death of the cross as consisting
precisely in this fact, that it was a supreme act
of self-renouncing obedience, as it is written (Phil. ii.
6-9): "Being in the form of God, He yet counted it
not a prize to be on an equality with God, but emptied
Himself, taking the form of a servant, being made
in the likeness of men; ... becoming obedient even
unto death, yea, the death of the cross. Wherefore
also God highly exalted Him, and gave unto Him the
name which is above every name."</p>

<p>And so the burnt-offering teaches us to remember
that Christ has not only died for our sins, but has also
consecrated Himself for us to God in full self-surrender
in our behalf. We are therefore to plead not only His
atoning death, but also the transcendent merit of His
life of full consecration to the Father's will. To this,
the words, three times repeated concerning the burnt-offering
(vv. 9, 13, 17), in this chapter, blessedly
apply: it is "an offering made by fire, of a sweet
savour," a fragrant odour, "unto the Lord." That is,
this full self-surrender of the holy Son of God unto the
Father is exceedingly delightful and acceptable unto
God. And for this reason it is for us an ever-prevailing
argument for our own acceptance, and for the
gracious bestowment for Christ's sake of all that there
is in Him for us.</p>

<p>Only let us ever remember that we cannot argue, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
in the case of the atoning death, that as Christ died
that we might not die, so He offered Himself in full
consecration unto God, that we might thus be released
from this obligation. Here the exact opposite is the
truth. For Christ Himself said in His memorable
prayer, just before His offering of Himself to death,
"For their sakes I sanctify (marg. "consecrate") Myself,
<em>that they also might be sanctified in truth</em>." And
thus is brought before us the thought, that if the sin-offering
emphasised, as we shall see, the substitutionary
death of Christ, whereby He became our righteousness,
the burnt-offering, as distinctively, brings before us
Christ as our sanctification, offering Himself without
spot, a whole burnt-offering to God. And as by that
one life of sinless obedience to the will of the Father
He procured our salvation by His merit, so in this
respect He has also become our one perfect Example of
what consecration to God really is. A thought this is
which, with evident allusion to the burnt-offering, the
Apostle Paul brings before us, charging us (Eph. v. 2)
that we "walk in love, as Christ also loved us, and
gave Himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God
for an odour of a sweet smell."</p>

<p>And the law further suggests that no extreme of
spiritual need can debar any one from availing himself
of our great Burnt-sacrifice. A burnt-offering was to
be received even from one who was so poor that he
could bring but a turtle-dove or a young pigeon (ver.
14). One might, at first thought, not unnaturally say:
Surely there can be nothing in this to point to Christ;
for the true Sacrifice is not many, but one and only.
And yet the very fact of this difference allowed in the
typical victims, when the reason of the allowance is
remembered, suggests the most precious truth concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Christ, that no spiritual poverty of the sinner
need exclude him from the full benefit of Christ's
saving work. Provision is made in Him for all those
who, most truly and with most reason, feel themselves
to be poor and in need of all things. Christ, as our
sanctification, is for all who will make use of Him; for
all who, feeling most deeply and painfully their own
failure in full consecration, would take Him, as not only
their sin-offering, but also their burnt-offering, both
their example and their strength, unto perfect self-surrender
unto God. We may well here recall to mind
the exhortation of the Apostle to Christian believers,
expressed in language which at once reminds us of the
burnt-offering (Rom. xii. 1): "I beseech you, brethren,
by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living
sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable
service."</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Continual Burnt-offering.</span></p>

<p class="center">vi. 8-13.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Command Aaron and his
sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt offering: the burnt offering
shall be on the hearth upon the altar all night unto the morning; and
the fire of the altar shall be kept burning thereon. And the priest
shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put
upon his flesh; and he shall take up the ashes whereto the fire hath
consumed the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside
the altar. And he shall put off his garments, and put on other
garments, and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean
place. And the fire upon the altar shall be kept burning thereon, it
shall not go out; and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning:
and he shall lay the burnt offering in order upon it, and shall burn
thereon the fat of the peace offerings. Fire shall be kept burning
upon the altar continually; it shall not go out."</p></blockquote>

<p>In chap. vi. 8-13 we have a "law of the burnt-offering"
specially addressed to "Aaron and his sons,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
and designed to secure that the fire of the burnt-offering
should be continually ascending unto God. In
chap. i. we have the law regarding burnt-offerings
brought by the individual Israelite. But besides these
it was ordered, Exod. xxix. 38-46, that every morning
and evening the priest should offer a lamb as a burnt-offering
for the whole people,&mdash;an offering which
primarily symbolised the constant renewal of Israel's
consecration as "a kingdom of priests" unto the Lord.
It is to this, the daily burnt-offering, that this supplementary
law of chap. vi. refers. All the regulations
are intended to provide for the uninterrupted maintenance
of this sacrificial fire; first, by the regular removal
of the ashes which would else cover and smother the
fire; and, secondly, by the supply of fuel. The removal
of the ashes from the fire is a priestly function;
hence it was ordained that the priest for this service
put on his robes of office, "his linen garment and his
linen breeches," and then take up the ashes from the
altar, and lay them by the side of the altar. But as
from time to time it would be necessary to remove
them from this place quite without the tent, it was
ordered that he should carry them forth "without the
camp unto a clean place," that the sanctity of all
connected with Jehovah's worship might never be lost
sight of; though, as it was forbidden to wear the
priestly garments except within the tent of meeting,
the priest, when this service was performed, must
"put on other garments," his ordinary, unofficial robes.
The ashes being thus removed from the altar each
morning, then the wood was put on, and the parts of
the lamb laid in order upon it to be perfectly consumed.
And whenever during the day any one might bring a
peace-offering unto the Lord, on this ever-burning fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the priest was to place also the fat, the richest part, of
the offering, and with it also the various individual
burnt-offerings and meal-offerings of each day. And
thus it was arranged by the law that, all day long, and
all night long, the smoke of the burnt-offering should
be continually ascending unto the Lord.</p>

<p>The significance of this can hardly be missed. By
this supplemental law which thus provided for "a
continual burnt-offering" to the Lord, it was first of
all signified to Israel, and to us, that the consecration
which the Lord so desires and requires from His people
is not occasional, but continuous. As the priest,
representing the nation, morning by morning cleared
away the ashes which had else covered the flame and
caused it to burn dull, and both morning by morning
and evening by evening, laid a new victim on the altar,
so will God have us do. Our self-consecration is not
to be occasional, but continual and habitual. Each
morning we should imitate the priest of old, in putting
away all that might dull the flame of our devotion, and,
morning by morning, when we arise, and evening by
evening, when we retire, by a solemn act of self-consecration
give ourselves anew unto the Lord. So
shall the word in substance, thrice repeated, be fulfilled
in us in its deepest, truest sense: "The fire shall be
kept burning on the altar continually; it shall not go
out" (vv. 9, 12, 13).</p>

<p>But we must not forget that in this part of the law,
as in all else, we are pointed to Christ. This ordinance
of the continual burnt-offering reminds us that Christ,
as our burnt-offering, <em>continually</em> offers Himself to God
in self-consecration in our behalf. Very significant it
is that the burnt-offering stands in contrast in this
respect with the sin-offering. We never read of a continual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
sin-offering; even the great annual sin-offering
of the day of atonement, which, like the daily burnt-offering,
had reference to the nation at large, was soon
finished, and once for all. And it was so with reason;
for in the nature of the case, our Lord's offering of
Himself for sin as an expiatory sacrifice was not and
could not be a continuous act. But with His presentation
of Himself unto God in full consecration
of His person as our Burnt-offering, it is different.
Throughout the days of His humiliation this self-offering
of Himself to God continued; nor, indeed,
can we say that it has yet ceased, or ever can cease.
For still, as the High Priest of the heavenly sanctuary,
He continually offers Himself as our Burnt-offering in
constantly renewed and constantly continued devotement
of Himself to the Father to do His will.</p>

<p>In this ordinance of the daily burnt-offering, ever
ascending in the fire that never went out, the idea of
the burnt-sacrifice reaches its fullest expression, the
type its most perfect development. And thus the law
of the burnt-offering leaves us in the presence of this
holy vision: the greater than Aaron, in the heavenly
place as our great Representative and Mediator, morning
by morning, evening by evening, offering Himself
unto the Father in the full self-devotement of His risen
life unto God, as our "continual burnt-offering." In
this, let us rejoice and be at peace.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<h3><em>THE MEAL-OFFERING.</em></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lev.</span> ii. 1-16; vi. 14-23.</p>


<p>The word which in the original uniformly stands
for the English "meal-offering" (A.V. "meat-offering,"
<em>i.e.</em>, "food-offering") primarily means simply
"a present," and is often properly so translated in the
Old Testament. It is, for example, the word which is
used (Gen. xxxii. 13) when we are told how Jacob
sent a present to Esau his brother; or, later, of the
gift sent by Israel to his son Joseph in Egypt (Gen.
xliii. 11); and, again (2 Sam. viii. 2), of the gifts sent
by the Moabites to David. Whenever thus used of
gifts to men, it will be found that it suggests a recognition
of the dignity and authority of the person to
whom the present is made, and, in many cases, a desire
also to procure thereby his favour.</p>

<p>In the great majority of cases, however, the word
is used of offerings to God, and in this use one or both
of these ideas can easily be traced. In Gen. iv. 4, 5,
in the account of the offerings of Cain and Abel, the
word is applied both to the bloody and the unbloody
offering; but in the Levitical law, it is only applied to
the latter. We thus find the fundamental idea of the
meal-offering to be this: it was a gift brought by the
worshipper to God, in token of his recognition of His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
supreme authority, and as an expression of desire for
His favour and blessing.</p>

<p>But although the meal-offering, like the burnt-offering,
was an offering made to God by fire, the differences
between them were many and significant. In the burnt-offering,
it was always a life that was given to God; in
the meal-offering, it was never a life, but always the
products of the soil. In the burnt-offering, again, the
offerer always set apart the offering by the laying on
of the hand, signifying thus, as we have seen, a transfer
of obligation to death for sin; thus connecting with the
offering, in addition to the idea of a gift to God, that
of expiation for sin, as preliminary to the offering by
fire. In the meal-offering, on the other hand, there
was no laying on of the hand, as there was no shedding
of blood, so that the idea of expiation for sin is in no
way symbolised. The conception of a gift to God,
which, though dominant in the burnt-offering, is not
in that the only thing symbolised, in the meal-offering
becomes the <em>only</em> thought the offering expresses.</p>

<p>It is further to be noted that not only must the
meal-offering consist of the products of the soil, but
of such alone as grow, not spontaneously, but by
cultivation, and thus represent the result of man's
labour. Not only so, but this last thought is the more
emphasised, that the grain of the offering was not to
be presented to the Lord in its natural condition as
harvested, but only when, by grinding, sifting, and
often, in addition, by cooking in various ways, it has
been more or less fully prepared to become the food
of man. In any case, it must, at least, be parched, as
in the variety of the offering which is last mentioned
in the chapter (vv. 14-16).</p>

<p>With these fundamental facts before us, we can now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
see what must have been the primary and distinctive
significance of the meal-offering, considered as an act
of worship. As the burnt-offering represented the
consecration of the life, the person, to God, so the
meal-offering represented the consecration of the fruit
of his labours.</p>

<p>If it be asked, why it was that when man's labours
are so manifold, and their results so diverse, the product
of the cultivation of the soil should be alone selected
for this purpose, for this, several reasons may be
given. In the first place, of all the occupations of
man, the cultivation of the soil is that of by far the
greatest number, and so, in the nature of the case,
must continue to be; for the sustenance of man, so
far as he is at all above the savage condition, comes,
in the last analysis, from the soil. Then, in particular,
the Israelites of those days of Moses were about to
become an agricultural nation. Most natural and suitable,
then, it was that the fruit of the activities of such
a people should be symbolised by the product of their
fields. And since even those who gained their living
in other ways than by the cultivation of the ground,
must needs purchase with their earnings grain and oil,
the meal-offering would, no less for them than for
others, represent the consecration to God of the fruit
of their labour.</p>

<p>The meal-offering is no longer an ordinance of
worship, but the duty which it signified remains in
full obligation still. Not only, in general, are we to
surrender our persons without reserve to the Lord,
as in the burnt-offering, but unto Him must also be
consecrated all our works.</p>

<p>This is true, first of all, regarding our religious
service. Each of us is sent into the world to do a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
certain spiritual work among our fellow-men. This
work and all the result of it is to be offered as a
holy meal-offering to the Lord. A German writer has
beautifully set forth this significance of the meal-offering
as regards Israel. "Israel's bodily calling was the
cultivation of the ground in the land given him by
Jehovah. The fruit of his calling, under the Divine
blessing, was corn and wine, his bodily food, which
nourished and sustained his bodily life. Israel's spiritual
calling was to work in the field of the kingdom
of God, in the vineyard of his Lord; this work was
Israel's covenant obligation. Of this, the fruit was the
spiritual bread, the spiritual nourishment, which should
sustain and develop his spiritual life."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> And the calling
of the spiritual Israel, which is the Church, is still the
same, to labour in the field of the kingdom of God, which
is the world of men; and the result of this work is still
the same, namely, with the Divine blessing, spiritual
fruit, sustaining and developing the spiritual life of men.
And in the meal-offering we are reminded that the fruit
of all our spiritual labours is to be offered to the Lord.</p>

<p>The reminder might seem unneedful, as indeed it
ought to be; but it is not. For it is sadly possible to
call Christ "Lord," and, labouring in His field, do in
His name many wonderful works, yet not really unto
Him. A minister of the Word may with steady labour
drive the ploughshare of the law, and sow continually
the undoubted seed of the Word in the Master's field;
and the apparent result of his work may be large, and
even real, in the conversion of men to God, and a great
increase of Christian zeal and activity. And yet it
is quite possible that a man do this, and still do it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
for himself, and not for the Lord; and when success
comes, begin to rejoice in his evident skill as a spiritual
husbandman, and in the praise of man which this brings
him; and so, while thus rejoicing in the fruit of his
labours, neglect to bring of this good corn and wine
which he has raised for a daily meal-offering in consecration
to the Lord. Most sad is this, and humiliating,
and yet sometimes it so comes to pass.</p>

<p>And so, indeed, it may be in every department of
religious activity. The present age is without its like
in the wonderful variety of its enterprise in matters
benevolent and religious. On every side we see an
ever-increasing army of labourers driving their various
work in the field of the world. City Missions of every
variety, Poor Committees with their free lodgings and
soup-kitchens, Young Men's Christian Associations,
Blue Ribbon Societies, the White Cross Army and the
Red Cross Army, Hospital Work, Prison Reform, and
so on;&mdash;there is no enumerating all the diverse improved
methods of spiritual husbandry around us, nor
can any one rightly depreciate the intrinsic excellence
of all this, or make light of the work or of its good
results. But for all this, there are signs that many
need to be reminded that all such labour in God's
field, however God may graciously make use of it, is
not necessarily labour for God; that labour for the
good of men is not therefore of necessity labour consecrated
to the Lord. For can we believe that from
all this the meal-offering is always brought to Him?
The ordinance of this offering needs to be remembered
by us all in connection with these things. The fruit of
all these our labours must be offered daily in solemn
consecration to the Lord.</p>

<p>But the teaching of the meal-offering reaches further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
than to what we call religious labours. For in that it
was appointed that the offering should consist of man's
daily food, Israel was reminded that God's claim for
full consecration of all our activities covers everything,
even to the very food we eat. There are many who
consecrate, or think they consecrate, their religious
activities; but seem never to have understood that
the consecration of the true Israelite must cover the
secular life as well,&mdash;the labour of the hand in the field,
in the shop, the transactions of the office or on 'Change,
and all their results, as also the recreations which we
are able to command, the very food and drink which
we use,&mdash;in a word, all the results and products of
our labours, even in secular things. And to bring this
idea vividly before Israel, it was ordered that the meal-offering
should consist of food, as the most common
and universal visible expression of the fruit of man's
secular activities. The New Testament has the same
thought (1 Cor. x. 31): "Whether ye eat or drink, or
whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God."</p>

<p>And the offering was not to consist of any food
which one might choose to bring, but of corn and oil,
variously prepared. Not to speak yet of any deeper
reason for this selection, there is one which lies quite
on the surface. For these were the most common and
universal articles of the food of the people. There were
articles of food, then as now, which were only to be seen
on the tables of the rich; but grain, in some form, was
and is a necessity for all. So also the oil, which was
that of the olive, was something which in that part of
the world, all, the poor no less than the rich, were
wont to use continually in the preparation of their
food; even as it is used to-day in Syria, Italy, and
other countries where the olive grows abundantly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Hence it appears that that was chosen for the offering
which all, the richest and the poorest alike, would be
sure to have; with the evident intent, that no one
might be able to plead poverty as an excuse for bringing
no meal-offering to the Lord.</p>

<p>Thus, if this ordinance of the meal-offering taught
that God's claim for consecration covers all our activities
and all their result, even to the very food that we eat,
it teaches also that this claim for consecration covers
all persons. From the statesman who administers the
affairs of an Empire to the day-labourer in the shop,
or mill, or field, all alike are hereby reminded that the
Lord requires that the work of every one shall be
brought and offered to Him in holy consecration.</p>

<p>And there was a further prescription, although not
mentioned here in so many words. In some offerings,
barley-meal was ordered, but for this offering the grain
presented, whether parched, in the ear, or ground into
meal, must be only wheat. The reason for this, and
the lesson which it teaches, are plain. For wheat, in
Israel, as still in most lands, was the best and most
valued of the grains. Israel must not only offer unto
God of the fruit of their labour, but the best result of
their labours. Not only so, but when the offering was
in the form of meal, cooked or uncooked, the best and
finest must be presented. That, in other words, must
be offered which represented the most of care and
labour in its preparation, or the equivalent of this
in purchase price. Which emphasises, in a slightly
different form, the same lesson as the foregoing. Out
of the fruit of our several labours and occupations we
are to set apart especially for God, not only that which
is best in itself, the finest of the wheat, but that which
has cost us the most labour. David finely represented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
this thought of the meal-offering when he said, concerning
the cattle for his burnt-offerings, which Araunah
the Jebusite would have him accept without price: "I
will not offer unto the Lord my God of that which doth
cost me nothing."</p>

<p>But in the meal-offering it was not the whole product
of his labour that the Israelite was directed to bring,
but only a small part. How could the consecration of
this small part represent the consecration of all? The
answer to this question is given by the Apostle Paul,
who calls attention to the fact that in the Levitical
symbolism it was ordained that the consecration of a
part should signify the consecration of the whole. For
he writes (Rom. xi. 16), "If the first-fruit is holy, then
the lump"&mdash;the whole from which the first-fruit is
taken&mdash;"is also holy;" that is, the consecration of a part
signifies and symbolically expresses the consecration of
the whole from which that part is taken. The idea is
well illustrated by a custom in India, according to which,
when one visits a man of distinction, he will offer the
guest a silver coin; an act of social etiquette which is
intended to express the thought that all he has is at
the service of the guest, and is therewith offered for
his use. And so in the meal-offering. By offering to
God, in this formal way, a part of the product of his
labour, the Israelite expressed a recognition of His
claim upon the whole, and professed a readiness to
place, not this part merely, but the whole, at God's
service.</p>

<p>But in the selection of the materials, we are pointed
toward a deeper symbolism, by the injunction that in
certain cases, at least, frankincense should be added to
the offering. But this was not of man's food, neither
was it, like the meal, and cakes, and oil, a product of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
man's labour. Its effect, naturally, was to give a grateful
perfume to the sacrifice, that it might be, even in
a physical sense, "an odour of a sweet smell." The
symbolical meaning of incense, in which the frankincense
was a chief ingredient, is very clearly intimated
in Holy Scripture. It is suggested in David's prayer
(Psalm cxli. 2): "Let my prayer be set forth as
incense; the lifting up of my hands, like the evening
oblation." So, in Luke i. 10, we read of the whole
multitude of the people praying without the sanctuary,
while the priest Zacharias was offering incense within.
And, finally, in the Apocalypse, this is expressly
declared to be the symbolical significance of incense;
for we read (v. 8), that the four-and-twenty elders
"fell down before the Lamb, having ... golden bowls
full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints."
So then, without doubt, we must understand it here.
In that frankincense was to be added to the meal-offering,
it is signified that this offering of the fruit of
our labours to the Lord must ever be accompanied by
prayer; and, further, that our prayers, thus offered in
this daily consecration, are most pleasing to the Lord,
even as the fragrance of sweet incense unto man.</p>

<p>But if the frankincense, in itself, had thus a symbolical
meaning, it is not unnatural to infer the same
also with regard to other elements of the sacrifice.
Nor is it, in view of the nature of the symbols, hard
to discover what that should be.</p>

<p>For inasmuch as that product of labour is selected
for the offering, which is the food by which men live,
we are reminded that this is to be the final aspect under
which all the fruit of our labours is to be regarded;
namely, as furnishing and supplying for the need of
the many that which shall be bread to the soul. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the highest sense, indeed, this can only be said of
Him who by His work became the Bread of Life for the
world, who was at once "the Sower" and "the Corn
of Wheat" cast into the ground; and yet, in a lower
sense, it is true that the work of feeding the multitudes
with the bread of life is the work of us all; and that
in all our labours and engagements we are to keep this
in mind as our supreme earthly object. Just as the
products of human labour are most diverse, and yet
all are capable of being exchanged in the market for
bread for the hungry, so are we to use all the products
of our labour with this end in view, that they may be
offered to the Lord as cakes of fine meal for the spiritual
sustenance of man.</p>

<p>And the oil, too, which entered into every form of
the meal-offering, has in Holy Scripture a constant
and invariable symbolical meaning. It is the uniform
symbol of the Holy Spirit of God. Isaiah lxi. 1 is
decisive on this point, where in prophecy the Messiah
speaks thus: "The Spirit of the Lord God is upon
me; because the Lord God hath anointed me to preach
good tidings." Quite in accord with this, we find that
when Jesus reached thirty years of age,&mdash;the time for
beginning priestly service,&mdash;He was set apart for His
work, not as the Levitical priests, by anointing with
symbolical oil, but by the anointing with the Holy
Ghost descending on Him at His baptism. So, also,
in the Apocalypse, the Church is symbolised by seven
golden candlesticks, or lamp-stands, supplied with oil
after the manner of that in the temple, reminding us
that as the lamp can give light only as supplied with
oil, so, if the Church is to be a light in the world, she
must be continually supplied with the Spirit of God.
Hence, the injunction that the meal of the offering be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
kneaded with oil, and that, of whatever form the offering
be, oil should be poured upon it, is intended,
according to this usage, to teach us, that in all work
which shall be offered so as to be acceptable to God,
must enter, as an inworking and abiding agent, the
life-giving Spirit of God.</p>

<p>It is another direction as to these meal-offerings, as
also regarding all offerings made by fire, that into them
should never enter leaven (ver. 11). The symbolical
significance of this prohibition is familiar to all. For
in all leaven is a principle of decay and corruption,
which, except its continued operation be arrested
betimes in our preparation of leavened food, will soon
make that in which it works offensive to the taste.
Hence, in Holy Scripture, leaven, without a single
exception, is the established symbol of spiritual corruption.
It is this, both as considered in itself, and in
virtue of its power of self-propagation in the leavened
mass. Hence the Apostle Paul, using familiar symbolism,
charged the Corinthians (1 Cor. v. 7) that they
"purge out from themselves the old leaven; and that
they keep festival, not with the leaven of malice and
wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity
and truth". Thus, in this prohibition is brought before
us the lesson, that we take heed to keep out of those
works which we present to God for consumption on
His altar the leaven of wickedness in every form. The
prohibition, in the same connection, of honey (ver. 11)
rests upon the same thought; namely, that honey, like
leaven, tends to promote fermentation and decay in
that with which it is mixed.</p>

<p>The Revised Version&mdash;in this case doubtless to be
preferred to the other&mdash;brings out a striking qualification
of this universal prohibition of leaven or honey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
in these words (ver. 12): "As an oblation of first-fruits
ye shall offer them unto the Lord; but they shall not
come up for a sweet savour on the altar."</p>

<p>Thus, as the prohibition of leaven and honey from
the meal-offering burned by fire upon the altar reminds
us that the Holy One demands absolute freedom from
all that is corrupt in the works of His people; on the
other hand, this gracious permission to offer leaven and
honey in the first-fruits (which were <em>not</em> burned on
the altar) seems intended to remind us that, nevertheless,
from the Israelite in covenant with God through
atoning blood, He is yet graciously pleased to accept
even offerings in which sinful imperfection is found,
so that only, as in the offering of first-fruits, there be
the hearty recognition of His rightful claim, before all
others, to the first and best we have.</p>

<p>In ver. 13 we have a last requisition as to the material
of the meal-offering: "Every oblation of thy meal-offering
shalt thou season with salt." As leaven is a
principle of impermanence and decay, so salt, on the
contrary, has the power of conservation from corruption.
Accordingly, to this day, among the most diverse peoples,
salt is the recognised symbol of incorruption and unchanging
perpetuity. Among the Arabs of to-day, for
example, when a compact or covenant is made between
different parties, it is the custom that each eat of salt,
which is passed around on the blade of a sword; by which
act they regard themselves as bound to be true, each
to the other, even at the peril of life. In like manner,
in India and other Eastern countries, the usual word
for perfidy and breach of faith is, literally, "unfaithfulness
to the salt;" and a man will say, "Can you
distrust me? Have I not eaten of your salt?" That
the symbol has this recognised meaning in the meal-offering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
is plain from the words which follow (ver. 13):
"Neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of
thy God to be wanting from thy meal-offering." In
the meal-offering, as in all offerings made by fire, the
thought was this: that Jehovah and the Israelite, as
it were, partake of salt together, in token of the eternal
permanence of the holy covenant of salvation into which
Israel has entered with God.</p>

<p>Herein we are taught, then, that by the consecration
of our labours to God we recognise the relation
between the believer and his Lord, as not occasional and
temporary, but eternal and incorruptible. In all our
consecration of our works to God, we are to keep this
thought in mind: "I am a man with whom God has
entered into an everlasting covenant, 'a covenant of
salt.'"</p>

<p>Three varieties of the meal-offering were prescribed:
the first (vv. 1-3), of uncooked meal; the second (vv.
4-11), of the same fine meal and oil, variously prepared
by cooking; the third (vv. 14-16), of the first
and best ears of the new grain, simply parched in the
fire. If any special significance is to be recognised in
this variety of the offerings, it may possibly be found
in this, that one form might be suited better than
another to persons of different resources. It has been
supposed that the different implements named&mdash;the
oven, the baking-pan or plate, the frying-pan&mdash;represent,
respectively, what different classes of the people
might be more or less likely to have. This thought
more certainly appears in the permission even of
parched grain, which then, as still in the East, while
used more or less by all, was especially the food of
the poorest of the people; such as might even be too
poor to own so much as an oven or a baking-pan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>In any case, the variety which was permitted teaches
us, that whatever form the product of our labour may
take, as determined either by our poverty or our riches,
or by whatever reason, God is graciously willing to accept
it, so the oil, frankincense, and salt be not wanting. It
is our privilege, as it is our duty, to offer of it in consecration
to our redeeming Lord, though it be no more
than parched corn. The smallness or meanness of
what we have to give, need not keep us back from
presenting our meal-offering.</p>

<p>If we have rightly understood the significance of
this offering, the ritual which is given will now easily
yield us its lessons. As in the case of the burnt-offering,
the meal-offering also must be brought unto
the Lord by the offerer himself. The consecration of
our works, like the consecration of our persons, must
be our own voluntary act. Yet the offering must be
delivered through the mediation of the priest; the
offerer must not presume himself to lay it on the altar.
Even so still. In this, as in all else, the Heavenly High
Priest must act in our behalf with God. We do not,
by our consecration of our works, therefore become
able to dispense with His offices as Mediator between
us and God. This is the thought of many, but it is
a great mistake. No offering made to God, except in
and through the appointed Priest, can be accepted of
Him.</p>

<p>It was next directed that the priest, having received
the offering at the hand of the worshipper, should make
a twofold use of it. In the burnt-offering the whole
was to be burnt; but in the meal-offering only a small
part. The priest was to take out of the offering, in
each case, "a memorial thereof, and burn it on the
altar"; and then it is added (vv. 3-10), "that which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
is left of the meal offering"&mdash;which was always much
the larger part&mdash;"shall be Aaron's and his sons'."
The small part taken out by the priest for the altar
was burnt with fire; and its consumption by the fire
of the altar, as in the other offerings, symbolised God's
gracious acceptance and appropriation of the offering.</p>

<p>But here the question naturally arises, if the total
consecration of the worshipper and his full acceptance
by God, in the case of the burnt-offering, was signified
by the burning of the whole, how is it that, in this case,
where also we must think of a consecration of the whole,
yet only a small part was offered to God in the fire of
the altar? But the difficulty is only in appearance.
For, no less than in the burnt-offering, all of the meal-offering
is presented to God, and all is no less truly
accepted by Him. The difference in the two cases is
only in the use to which God puts the offering. A
part of the meal-offering is burnt on the altar as "a
memorial," to signify that God takes notice of and
graciously accepts the consecrated fruit of our labours.
It is called "a memorial" in that, so to speak, it
reminded the Lord of the service and devotion of His
faithful servant. The thought is well illustrated by the
words of Nehemiah (v. 19), who said: "Think upon
me, O Lord, for good, according to all that I have done
for this people;" and by the word of the angel to
Cornelius (Acts x. 4): "Thy prayers and thine alms are
gone up for a memorial before God;" for a memorial
in such wise as to procure to him a gracious visitation.</p>

<p>The remaining and larger portion of the meal-offering
was given to the priest, as being the servant of
God in the work of His house. To this service he was
set apart from secular occupations, that he might give
himself wholly to the duties of this office. In this he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
must needs be supported; and to this end it was
ordained by God that a certain part of the various
offerings should be given him, as we shall see more
fully hereafter.</p>

<p>In striking contrast with this ordinance, which gave
the largest part of the meal-offering to the priest, is
the law that of the frankincense he must take nothing;
"all" must go up to God, with the "memorial," in the
fire of the altar (vv. 2, 16). But in consistency with
the symbolism it could not be otherwise. For the
frankincense was the emblem of prayer, adoration, and
praise; of this, then, the priest must take nought for
himself. The manifest lesson is one for all who preach
the Gospel. Of the incense of praise which may ascend
from the hearts of God's people, as they minister the
Word, they must take none for themselves. "Not unto
us, O Lord, but unto Thy name be the glory."</p>

<p>Such then was the meaning of the meal-offering. It
represents the consecration unto God by the grace of
the Holy Spirit, with prayer and praise, of all the work
of our hands; an offering with salt, but without leaven,
in token of our unchanging covenant with a holy God.
And God accepts the offerings thus presented by His
people, as a savour of a sweet smell, with which He is
well pleased. We have called this consecration a duty;
is it not rather a most exalted privilege?</p>

<p>Only let us remember, that although our consecrated
offerings are accepted, we are not accepted because of
the offerings. Most instructive it is to observe that
the meal-offerings were not to be offered alone; a
bloody sacrifice, a burnt-offering or sin-offering, must
always precede. How vividly this brings before us the
truth that it is only when first our persons have been
cleansed by atoning blood, and thus and therefore consecrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
unto God, that the consecration and acceptance
of our works is possible. We are not accepted because
we consecrate our works, but our consecrated works
themselves are accepted because first we have been
"accepted in the Beloved" through faith in the blood
of the holy Lamb of God.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Daily Meal-Offering.</span></p>

<p class="center">vi. 14-23.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And this is the law of the meal-offering: the sons of Aaron shall
offer it before the Lord, before the altar. And he shall take up therefrom
his handful, of the fine flour of the meal-offering and of the oil
thereof, and all the frankincense which is upon the meal-offering,
and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour, as the memorial
thereof, unto the Lord. And that which is left thereof shall Aaron
and his sons eat: it shall be eaten without leaven in a holy place: in
the court of the tent of meeting they shall eat it. It shall not be
baken with leaven. I have given it as their portion of My offerings
made by fire; it is most holy, as the sin-offering, and as the guilt-offering.
Every male among the children of Aaron shall eat of it, as
a due for ever throughout your generations, from the offerings of the
Lord made by fire: whosoever toucheth them shall be holy. And
the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, This is the oblation of Aaron and
of his sons, which they shall offer unto the Lord in the day when he
is anointed; the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering
perpetually, half of it in the morning, and half thereof in the evening.
On a baking-pan it shall be made with oil; when it is soaked, thou
shalt bring it in: in baken pieces shalt thou offer the meal-offering
for a sweet savour unto the Lord. And the anointed priest that shall
be in his stead from among his sons shall offer it: by a statute for
ever it shall be wholly burnt unto the Lord. And every meal-offering
of the priest shall be wholly burnt: it shall not be eaten."</p></blockquote>

<p>As there were not only the burnt-offerings of the
individual Israelite, but also a daily burnt-offering,
morning and evening, presented by the priest as the
representative of the collective nation, so also with the
meal-offering. The law concerning this daily meal-offering
is given in chap. vi. 19. The amount in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
case was prescribed, being apparently the amount
regarded as a day's portion of food&mdash;"the tenth part of
an ephah of fine flour," half of which was to be offered
in the morning and half in the evening, made on a
baking pan with oil, "for a sweet savour unto the
Lord." Unlike the meal-offering of the individual, it
is said, "by a statute for ever, it shall be wholly burnt
unto the Lord.... Every meal-offering of the priest
shall be wholly burnt; it shall not be eaten." This
single variation from the ordinance of chap. ii. is
simply an application of the principle which governs
all the sacrifices except the peace-offering, that he who
offered any sacrifice could never himself eat of it; and
as the priest in this case was the offerer, the symbolism
required that he should himself have nothing of the
offering, as being wholly given by him to the Lord.
And this meal-offering was to be presented, not
merely, as some have inferred from ver. 20, on the day
of the anointing of the high priest, but, as is expressly
said, "perpetually."</p>

<p>The typical meaning of the meal-offering, and, in
particular, of this daily meal-offering, which, as we
learn from Exod. xxx. 39, 40, was offered with the
daily burnt-offering, is very clear. Every meal-offering
pointed to Christ in His consecration of all His works
to the Father. And as the daily burnt-offering presented
by Aaron and his sons typified our heavenly
High Priest as offering His person in daily consecration
unto God in our behalf, so, in the daily meal-offering,
wholly burnt upon the altar, we see Him in
like manner offering unto God in perfect consecration,
day by day, perpetually, all His works for our acceptance.
To the believer, often sorely oppressed with the
sense of the imperfection of his own consecration of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
his daily works, in that because of this the Father is
not glorified by him as He should be, how exceedingly
comforting this view of Christ! For that which, at the
best, we do so imperfectly and interruptedly, He does
in our behalf perfectly, and with never-failing constancy;
thus at once perfectly glorifying the Father, and also,
through the virtue of the boundless merit of this consecration,
constantly procuring for us daily grace unto
the life eternal.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<h3><em>THE PEACE-OFFERING.</em></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lev.</span> iii. 1-17; vii. 11-34; xix. 5-8; xxii. 21-25.</p>


<p>In chap. iii. is given, though not with completeness,
the law of the peace-offering. The alternative
rendering of this term, "thank-offering" (marg. R.V.),
precisely expresses only one variety of the peace-offering;
and while it is probably impossible to find
any one word that shall express in a satisfactory way
the whole conception of this offering, it is not easy
to find one better than the familiar term which the
Revisers have happily retained. As will be made clear
in the sequel, it was the main object of this offering,
as consisting of a sacrifice terminating in a festive
sacrificial meal, to express the conception of friendship,
peace, and fellowship with God as secured by the
shedding of atoning blood.</p>

<p>Like the burnt-offering and the meal-offering, the
peace-offering had come down from the times before
Moses. We read of it, though not explicitly named, in
Gen. xxxi. 54, on the occasion of the covenant between
Jacob and Laban, wherein they jointly took God as
witness of their covenant of friendship; and, again, in
Exod. xviii. 12, where "Jethro took a burnt-offering and
sacrifices for God; and Aaron came and all the elders
of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
God." Nor was this form of sacrifice, any more than
the burnt-offering, confined to the line of Abraham's
seed. Indeed, scarcely any religious custom has from
the most remote antiquity been more universally observed
than this of a sacrifice essentially connected
with a sacrificial meal. An instance of the heathen
form of this sacrifice is even given in the Pentateuch,
where we are told (Exod. xxxii. 6) how the people, having
made the golden calf, worshipped it with peace-offerings,
and sat down to eat and to drink at the sacrificial
meal which was inseparable from the peace-offering;
while in 1 Cor. x. Paul refers to like sacrificial feasts
as common among the idolaters of Corinth.</p>

<p>It hardly needs to be again remarked that there is
nothing in such facts as these to trouble the faith of
the Christian, any more than in the general prevalence
of worship and of prayer among heathen nations.
Rather, in all these cases alike, are we to see the
expression on the part of man of a sense of need and
want, especially, in this case, of friendship and fellowship
with God; and, seeing that the conception of a
sacrifice culminating in a feast was, in truth, most
happily adapted to symbolise this idea, surely it were
nothing strange that God should base the ordinances
of His own worship upon such universal conceptions
and customs, correcting in them only, as we shall see,
what might directly or indirectly misrepresent truth.
Where an alphabet, so to speak, is thus already found
existing, whether in letters or in symbols, why should
the Lord communicate a new and unfamiliar symbolism,
which, because new and unfamiliar, would have been,
for that reason, far less likely to be understood?</p>

<p>The plan of chap. iii. is very simple; and there is
little in its phraseology requiring explanation. Prescriptions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
are given for the offering of peace-offerings,
first, from the herd (vv. 1-5); then, from the flock,
whether of the sheep (vv. 6-11) or of the goats
(vv. 12-16). After each of these three sections it is
formally declared of each offering that it is "a sweet
savour," "an offering made by fire," or "the food of
the offering made by fire unto the Lord." The chapter
then closes with a prohibition, specially occasioned by
the directions for this sacrifice, of all use by Israel of
fat or blood as food.</p>

<p>The regulations relating to the selection of the victim
for the offering differ from those for the burnt-offering
in allowing a greater liberty of choice. A female was
permitted, as well as a male; though recorded instances
of the observance of the peace-offering indicate that
the male was even here preferred when obtainable.
The offering of a dove or a pigeon is not, however,
mentioned as permissible, as in the case of the burnt-offering.
But this is no exception to the rule of greater
liberty of choice, since these were excluded by the
object of the offering as a sacrificial meal, for which,
obviously, a small bird would be insufficient. Ordinarily,
the victim must be without blemish; and yet,
even in this matter, a larger liberty was allowed
(chap. xxii. 23) in the case of those which were termed
"free-will offerings," where it was permitted to offer even
a bullock or a lamb which might have "some part superfluous
or lacking." The latitude of choice thus allowed
finds its sufficient explanation in the fact that while the
idea of representation and expiation had a place in the
peace-offering as in all bloody offerings, yet this was
subordinate to the chief intent of the sacrifice, which
was to represent the victim as food given by God to
Israel in the sacrificial meal. It is to be observed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
only such defects are therefore allowed in the victim
as could not possibly affect its value as food. And so
even already, in these regulations as to the selection of
the victim, we have a hint that we have now to do with
a type, in which the dominant thought is not so much
Christ, the Holy Victim, our representative, as Christ
the Lamb of God, the food of the soul, through participation
in which we have fellowship with God.</p>

<p>As before remarked, the ritual acts in the bloody
sacrifices are, in all, six, each of which, in the peace-offering,
has its proper place. Of these, the first four,
namely, the presentation, the laying on of the hand,
the killing of the victim, and the sprinkling of the blood,
are precisely the same as in the burnt-offering, and
have the same symbolic and typical significance. In
both the burnt-offering and the peace-offering, the
innocent victim typified the Lamb of God, presented
by the sinner in the act of faith to God as an atonement
for sin through substitutionary death; and the sprinkling
of the blood upon the altar signifies in this, as in
the other, the application of that blood Godward by the
Divine Priest acting in our behalf, and thereby procuring
for us remission of sin, redemption through the
blood of the slain Lamb.</p>

<p>In the other two ceremonies, namely, the burning
and the sacrificial meal, the peace-offering stands in
strong contrast with the burnt-offering. In the burnt-offering
all was burned upon the altar; in the peace-offering
all the fat, and that only. The detailed
directions which are given in the case of each class of
victims are intended simply to direct the selection of
those parts of the animal in which the fat is chiefly
found. They are precisely the same for each, except
in the case of the sheep. With regard to such a victim,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
the particular is added, according to King James's version,
"the whole rump;" but the Revisers have with
abundant reason corrected this translation, giving it
correctly as "the fat tail entire." The change is an
instructive one, as it points to the idea which determined
this selection of all the fat for the offering by
fire. For the reference is to a special breed of sheep
which is still found in Palestine, Arabia, and North
Africa. With these, the tail grows to an immense
size, sometimes weighing fifteen pounds or more, and
consists almost entirely of a rich substance, in character
between fat and marrow. By the Orientals in the
regions where this variety of sheep is found it is still
esteemed as the most valuable part of the animal for
food. And thus, just as in the meal-offering the Israelite
was required to bring out of all his grain the best, and
of his meal the finest, so in the peace-offering he is
required to bring the fat, and in the case of the sheep
this fat tail, as the best and richest parts, to be burnt
upon the altar to Jehovah. And the burning, as in
the whole burnt-sacrifice, was, so to speak, the visible
Divine appropriation of that which was placed upon
the altar, the best of the offering, as appointed to be
"the food of God." If the symbolism, at first thought,
perplex any, we have but to remember how frequently
in Scripture "fat" and "fatness" are used as the
symbol of that which is richest and best; as, <em>e.g.</em>,
where the Psalmist says, "They shall be abundantly
satisfied with the fatness of Thy house;" and Isaiah,
"Come unto Me, and let your soul delight itself in
fatness." Thus when, in the peace-offering, of which
the larger part was intended for food, it is ordered
that the fat should be given to God in the fire of the
altar, the same lesson is taught as in the meal-offering,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
namely, God is ever to be served first and with the
best that we have. "All the fat is the Lord's."</p>

<p>In the burnt-offering, the burning ended the ceremonial:
in the nature of the case, since all was to be
burnt, the object of the sacrifice was attained when the
burning was completed. But in the case of the peace-offering,
to the burning of the fat upon the altar now
followed the culminating act of the ritual, in the eating
of the sacrifice. In this, however, we must distinguish
from the eating by the offerer and his household, the
eating by the priests; of which only the first-named
properly belonged to the ceremonial of the sacrifice.
The assignment of certain parts of the sacrifice to be
eaten by the priests has the same meaning as in the
meal-offering. These portions were regarded in the
law as given, not by the offerer, but by God, to His
servants the priests; that they might eat them, not as
a ceremonial act, but as their appointed sustenance
from His table whom they served. To this we shall
return in a subsequent chapter, and therefore need not
dwell upon it here.</p>

<p>This eating of the sacrifice by the priests has thus
not yet taken us beyond the conception of the meal-offering,
with a part of which they, in like manner, by
God's arrangement, were fed. Quite different, however,
is the sacrificial eating by the offerer which follows.
He had brought the appointed victim; it had been slain
in his behalf; the blood had been sprinkled for atonement
on the altar; the fat had been taken off and
burned upon the altar; the thigh and breast had been
given back by God to the officiating priest; and now,
last of all, the offerer himself receives back from God,
as it were, the remainder of the flesh of the victim, that
he himself might eat it before Jehovah. The chapter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
before us gives no directions as to this sacrificial eating;
these are given in Deut. xii. 6, 7, 17, 18, to which
passage, in order to the full understanding of that
which is most distinctive in the peace-offering, we must
refer. In the two verses last named, we have a regulation
which covers, not only the peace-offerings, but
with them all other sacrificial eatings, thus: "Thou
mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn,
or of thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of
thy herd or of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which
thou vowest, nor thy free-will offerings, nor the heave-offering
of thy hand: but thou shalt eat them before
the Lord thy God in the place which the Lord thy God
shall choose, thou and thy son, and thy daughter, and
my man-servant, and thy maid-servant, and the Levite
that is within thy gates; and thou shalt rejoice before
the Lord thy God in all that thou puttest thy hand
unto."</p>

<p>In these directions are three particulars; the offerings
were to be eaten, by the offerer, not at his own home,
but before Jehovah at the central sanctuary; he was
to include in this sacrificial feast all the members of
his family, and any Levite that might be stopping with
him; and he was to make the feast an occasion of holy
joy before the Lord in the labour of his hands. What
was now the special significance of all this? As this
was the special characteristic of the peace-offering, the
answer to this question will point us to its true significance,
both for Israel in the first place, and then for
us as well, as a type of Him who was to come.</p>

<p>It is not hard to perceive the significance of a feast
as a symbol. It is a natural and suitable expression
of friendship and fellowship. He who gives the feast
thereby shows to the guests his friendship toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
them, in inviting them to partake of the food of his
house. And if, in any case, there has been an interruption
or breach of friendship, such an invitation to
a feast, and association in it of the formerly alienated
parties, is a declaration on the part of him who gives
the feast, as also of those who accept his invitation,
that the breach is healed, and that where there was
enmity, is now peace.</p>

<p>So natural is this symbolism that, as above remarked,
it has been a custom very widely spread among heathen
peoples to observe sacrificial feasts, very like to this
peace-offering of the Hebrews, wherein a victim is first
offered to some deity, and its flesh then eaten by the
offerer and his friends. Of such sacrificial feasts we
read in ancient Babylonia and Assyria, in Persia,
and, in modern times, among the Arabs, Hindoos, and
Chinese, and various native races of the American
continent; always having the same symbolic intent
and meaning&mdash;namely, an expression of desire after
friendship and intercommunion with the deity thus
worshipped. The existence of this custom in Old
Testament days is recognised in Isa. lxv. 11 (R.V.),
where God charges the idolatrous Israelites with preparing
"a table for the god Fortune," and filling up
"mingled wine unto (the goddess) Destiny"&mdash;certain
Babylonian (?) deities; and in the New Testament, as
already remarked, the Apostle Paul refers to the same
custom among the idolatrous Greeks of Corinth.</p>

<p>And because this symbolic meaning of a feast is as
suitable and natural as it is universal, we find that in
the symbolism of Holy Scripture, eating and drinking,
and especially the feast, has been appropriated by the
Holy Spirit to express precisely the same ideas of
reconciliation, friendship, and intercommunion between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the giver of the feast and the guest, as in all the great
heathen religions. We meet this thought, for instance,
in Psalm xxii. 5: "Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of my enemies;" and in Psalm xxxvi. 8,
where it is said of God's people: "They shall be
abundantly satisfied with the fatness of Thy house;"
and again, in the grand prophecy in Isaiah, xxv., of
the final redemption of all the long-estranged nations,
we read that when God shall destroy in Mount Zion
"the veil that is spread over all nations, and swallow up
death for ever," then "the Lord of hosts shall make unto
all peoples a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the
lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees
well refined." And in the New Testament, the symbolism
is taken up again, and used repeatedly by our Lord,
as, for example, in the parables of the Great Supper
(Luke xiv. 15-24) and the Prodigal Son (Luke xv. 23),
the Marriage of the King's Son (Matt. xxii. 1-14), concerning
the blessings of redemption; and also in that
ordinance of the Holy Supper, which He has appointed
to be a continual reminder of our relation to Himself,
and means for the communication of His grace, through
our symbolic eating therein of the flesh of the slain
Lamb of God.</p>

<p>Thus, nothing in the Levitical symbolism is better
certified to us than the meaning of the feast of the
peace-offering. Employing a symbol already familiar
to the world for centuries, God ordained this eating
of the peace-offering in Israel, to be the symbolic
expression of peace and fellowship with Himself. In
Israel it was to be eaten "before the Lord," and, as
well it might be, "with rejoicing."</p>

<p>But, just at this point, the question has been raised:
How are we to conceive of the sacrificial feast of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
peace-offering? Was it a feast offered and presented
by the Israelite to God, or a feast given by God to
the Israelite? In other words, in this feast, who was
represented as host, and who as guest? Among other
nations than the Hebrews, it was the thought in such
cases that the feast was given by the worshipper to
his god. This is well illustrated by an Assyrian
inscription of Esarhaddon, who, in describing his palace
at Nineveh, says: "I filled with beauties the great
palace of my empire, and I called it 'the Palace which
rivals the World.' Ashur, Ishtar of Nineveh, and the
gods of Assyria, all of them, I feasted within it. Victims,
precious and beautiful, I sacrificed before them,
and I caused them to receive my gifts."</p>

<p>But here we come upon one of the most striking and
instructive contrasts between the heathen conception of
the sacrificial feast and the same symbolism as used in
Leviticus and other Scripture. In the heathen sacrificial
feasts, it is man who feasts God; in the peace-offering
of Leviticus, it is God who feasts man. Some
have indeed denied that this is the conception of the
peace-offering, but most strangely. It is true that the
offerer, in the first instance, had brought the victim;
but it seems to be forgotten by such, that prior to the
feasting he had already given the victim to God, to
be offered in expiation for sin. From that time the
victim was no longer, any part of it, his own property,
but God's. God having received the offering, now
directs what use shall be made of it; a part shall be
burned upon the altar; another part He gives to the
priests, His servants; with the remaining part He
now feasts the worshipper.</p>

<p>And as if to make this clearer yet, while Esarhaddon,
for example, gives his feast to the gods, not in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
their temples, but in his own palace, as himself the
host and giver of the feast, the Israelite, on the contrary,&mdash;that
he might not, like the heathen, complacently
imagine himself to be feasting God,&mdash;is directed to eat
the peace-offering, not at his own house, but at God's
house. In this way God was set forth as the host, the
One who gave the feast, to whose house the Israelite
was invited, at whose table he was to eat.</p>

<p>Profoundly suggestive and instructive is this contrast
between the heathen custom in this offering, and the
Levitical ordinance. For do we not strike here one
of the deepest points of contrast between all of man's
religion, and the Gospel of God? Man's idea always
is, until taught better by God, "I will be religious
and make God my friend, by doing something, giving
something for God." God, on the contrary, teaches
us in this symbolism, as in all Scripture, the exact
reverse; that we become truly religious by taking,
first of all, with thankfulness and joy, what He has
provided for us. A breach of friendship between man
and God is often implied in the heathen rituals, as in
the ritual of Leviticus; as also, in both, a desire for
its removal, and renewed fellowship with God. But
in the former, man ever seeks to attain to this intercommunion
of friendship by something that he himself
will do for God. He will feast God, and thus God
shall be well pleased. But God's way is the opposite!
The sacrificial feast at which man shall have fellowship
with God is provided not by man for God, but by
God for man, and is to be eaten, not in our house, but
spiritually partaken in the presence of the invisible God.</p>

<p>We can now perceive the teaching of the peace-offering
for Israel. In Israel, as among all the nations,
was the inborn craving after fellowship and friendship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
with God. The ritual of the peace-offering taught him
how it was to be obtained, and how communion might
be realised. The first thing was for him to bring and
present a divinely-appointed victim; and then, the
laying of the hand upon his head with confession of
sin; then, the slaying of the victim, the sprinkling of
its blood, and the offering of its choicest parts to God
in the altar fire. Till all this was done, till in symbol
expiation had been thus made for the Israelite's sin,
there could be no feast which should speak of friendship
and fellowship with God. But this being first
done, God now, in token of His free forgiveness and
restoration to favour, invites the Israelite to a joyful
feast in His own house.</p>

<p>What a beautiful symbol! Who can fail to appreciate
its meaning when once pointed out? Let us
imagine that through some fault of ours a dear friend
has become estranged; we used to eat and drink at
his house, but there has been none of that now for a
long time. We are troubled, and perhaps seek out
one who is our friend's friend and also our friend, to
whose kindly interest we entrust our case, to reconcile
to us the one we have offended. He has gone to
mediate; we anxiously await his return; but or ever
he has come back again, comes an invitation from him
who was estranged, just in the old loving way, asking
that we will eat with him at his house. Any one of us
would understand this; we should be sure at once that
the mediator had healed the breach, that we were
forgiven, and were welcome as of old to all that our
friend's friendship had to give.</p>

<p>But God is the good Friend whom we have estranged;
and the Lord Jesus, His beloved Son, and our own
Friend as well, is the Mediator; and He has healed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
breach; having made expiation for our sin in offering
His own body as a sacrifice, He has ascended into
heaven, there to appear in the presence of God for us;
He has not yet returned. But meantime the message
comes down from Him to all who are hungering after
peace with God: "The feast is made; and ye all are
invited; come! all things are now ready!" And this
is the message of the Gospel. It is the peace-offering
translated into words. Can we hesitate to accept the
invitation? Or, if we have sent in our acceptance, do
we need to be told, as in Deuteronomy, that we are to
eat "with rejoicing."</p>

<p>And now we may well observe another circumstance
of profound typical significance. When the Israelite
came to God's house to eat before Jehovah, he was fed
there with the flesh of the slain victim. The flesh of
that very victim whose blood had been given for him
on the altar, now becomes his food to sustain the life
thus redeemed. Whether the Israelite saw into the
full meaning of this, we may easily doubt; but it leads
us on now to consider, in the clearer light of the New
Testament, the deepest significance of the peace-offering
and its ritual, as typical of our Lord and our relation
to Him.</p>

<p>That the victim of the peace-offering, as of all the
bloody offerings, was intended to typify Christ, and
that the death of that victim, in the peace-offering, as
in all the bloody offerings, foreshadowed the death of
Christ for our sins,&mdash;this needs no further proof. And
so, again, as the burning of the whole burnt-offering
represented Christ as accepted for us in virtue of His
perfect consecration to the Father, so the peace-offering,
in that the fat is burned, represents Christ as accepted
for us, in that He gave to God in our behalf the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
best He had to offer. For in that incomparable
sacrifice we are to think not only of the completeness
of Christ's consecration for us, but also of the supreme
excellence of that which He offered unto God for us.
All that was best in Him, reason, affection, and will, as
well as the members of His holy body,&mdash;nay, the Godhead
as well as the Manhood, in the holy mystery of
the Trinity and the Incarnation, He offered for us unto
the Father.</p>

<p>This, however, has taken us as yet but little beyond
the meaning of the burnt-offering. The closing act of
the ritual, the sacrificial eating, however, reaches in its
typical significance far beyond this or any of the bloody
offerings.</p>

<p>First, in that he who had laid his hand upon the
victim, and for whom the blood had been sprinkled, is
now invited by God to feast in His house, upon food
given by himself, the food of the sacrifice, which is
called in the ritual "the bread of God," the eating of
the peace-offering symbolically teaches us that if we
have indeed presented the Lamb of God as our peace,
not only has the Priest sprinkled for us the blood, so
that our sin is pardoned, but, in token of friendship
now restored, God invites the penitent believer to sit
down at His own table,&mdash;in a word, to joyful fellowship
with Himself! Which means, if our weak faith but
take it in, that the Almighty and Most Holy God now
invites us to fellowship in all the riches of His Godhead;
places all that He has at the service of the
believing sinner, redeemed by the blood of the slain
Lamb. The prodigal has returned; the Father will
now feast him with the best that He has. Fellowship
with God through reconciliation by the blood of the
slain Lamb,&mdash;this then is the first thing shadowed forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
in this part of the ritual of the peace-offering. It is
a sufficiently wonderful thought, but there is truth yet
more wonderful veiled under this symbolism.</p>

<p>For when we ask, what then was the bread or food of
God, of which He invited him to partake who brought
the peace-offering, and learn that it was the flesh of the
slain victim; here we meet a thought which goes far
beyond atonement by the shedding of blood. The
same victim whose blood was shed and sprinkled in
atonement for sin is now given by God to be the
redeemed Israelite's food, by which his life shall be
sustained! Surely we cannot mistake the meaning of
this. For the victim of the altar and the food of the
table are one and the same. Even so He who offered
Himself for our sins on Calvary, is now given by God
to be the food of the believer; who now thus lives by
"eating the flesh" of the slain Lamb of God. Does
this imagery, at first thought, seem strange and unnatural?
So did it also seem strange to the Jews,
when in reply to our Lord's teaching they wonderingly
asked (John vi. 52), "How can this man give us His
flesh to eat?" And yet so Christ spoke; and when
He had first declared Himself to the Jews as the
Antitype of the manna, the true Bread sent down from
heaven, He then went on to say, in words which far
transcended the meaning of that type (John vi. 51),
"The bread which I will give is My flesh, for the life of
the world." How the light begins now to flash back from
the Gospel to the Levitical law, and from this, again,
back to the Gospel! In the one we read, "Ye shall
eat the flesh of your peace-offerings before the Lord
with joy;" in the other, the word of the Lord Jesus
concerning Himself (John vi. 33, 55, 57): "The bread
of God is that which cometh down out of heaven, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
giveth life unto the world.... My flesh is meat indeed,
and My blood is drink indeed.... As the living Father
sent Me, and I live because of the Father, so he that
eateth Me, he also shall live because of Me." And
now the Shekinah light of the ancient tent of meeting
begins to illumine even the sacramental table, and as
we listen to the words of Jesus, "Take, eat! this is
My body which was broken for you," we are reminded
of the feast of the peace-offerings. The Israel of God
is to be fed with the flesh of the sacrificed Lamb which
became their peace.</p>

<p>Let us hold fast then to this deepest thought of
the peace-offering, a truth too little understood even by
many true believers. The very Christ who died for
our sins, if we have by faith accepted His atonement
and have been for His sake forgiven, is now given us
by God for the sustenance of our purchased life. Let
us make use of Him, daily feeding upon Him, that so we
may live and grow unto the life eternal!</p>

<p>But there is yet one thought more concerning this
matter, which the peace-offering, as far as was possible,
shadowed forth. Although Christ becomes the bread
of God for us only through His offering of Himself
first for our sins, as our atonement, yet this is something
quite distinct from atonement. Christ became
our sacrifice once for all; the atonement is wholly a
fact of the past. But Christ is now still, and will ever
continue to be unto all His people, the bread or food of
God, by eating whom they live. He was the propitiation,
as the slain victim; but, in virtue of that, He is
now become the flesh of the peace-offering. Hence He
must be this, not as dead, but as living, in the present
resurrection life of His glorified humanity. Here
evidently is a fact which could not be directly symbolised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
in the peace-offering without a miracle ever repeated.
For Israel ate of the victim, not as living, but
as dead. It could not be otherwise. And yet there is
a regulation of the ritual (chap. vii. 15-18; xix. 6, 7)
which suggests this phase of truth as clearly as possible
without a miracle. It was ordered that none of the flesh
of the peace-offering should be allowed to remain beyond
the third day; if any then was left uneaten, it was to
be burned with fire. The reason for this lies upon
the surface. It was doubtless that there might be no
possible beginning of decay; and thus it was secured
that the flesh of the victim with which God fed the
accepted Israelite should be the flesh of a victim that
was not to see corruption. But does not this at once
remind us how it was written of the Antitype, "Thou
wilt not suffer Thy Holy One to see corruption"? while,
moreover, the extreme limit of time allowed further
reminds us how it was precisely on the third day that
Christ rose from the dead in the incorruptible life of
the resurrection, that so He might through all time continue
to be the living bread of His people.</p>

<p>And thus this special regulation points us not indistinctly
toward the New Testament truth that Christ is
now unto us the bread of God, not merely as the One
who died, but as the One who, living again, was not
allowed to see corruption. For so the Apostle argues
(Rom. v. 11), that "being justified by faith," and so
having "peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,"
our peace-offering, having been thus "reconciled by His
death, we shall now be saved by His life." And thus,
as we appropriate Christ crucified as our atonement,
so by a like faith we are to appropriate Christ risen as
our life, to be for us as the flesh of the peace-offering,
our nourishment and strength by which we live.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Prohibition of Fat and Blood.</span></p>

<p class="center">iii. 16, 17; vii. 22-27; xvii. 10-16.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food of
the offering made by fire, for a sweet savour: all the fat is the Lord's.
It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your
dwellings, that ye shall eat neither fat nor blood.... And the Lord
spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, saying,
Ye shall eat no fat, of ox, or sheep, or goat. And the fat of that which
dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn of beasts, may be used
for any other service: but ye shall in no wise eat of it. For whosoever
eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made
by fire unto the Lord, even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from
his people. And ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of
fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings. Whosoever it be that
eateth any blood, that soul shall be cut off from his people.... And
whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers
that sojourn among them, that eateth any manner of blood; I will set
My face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from
among his people. For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I
have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls:
for it is the blood that maketh atonement by reason of the life.
Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat
blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood.
And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the
strangers that sojourn among them, which taketh in hunting any
beast or fowl that may be eaten; he shall pour out the blood thereof,
and cover it with dust. For as to the life of all flesh, the blood
thereof is all one with the life thereof: therefore I said unto the
children of Israel, Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh: for
the life of all flesh is the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be
cut off. And every soul that eateth that which dieth of itself, or that
which is torn of beasts, whether he be homeborn or a stranger, he
shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean
until the even: then shall he be clean. But if he wash them not, nor
bathe his flesh, then he shall bear his iniquity."</p></blockquote>

<p>The chapter concerning the peace-offering ends
(vv. 16, 17) with these words: "All the fat is the
Lord's. It shall be a perpetual statute for you throughout
your generations, that ye shall eat neither fat nor
blood."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>To this prohibition so much importance was attached
that in the supplemental "law of the peace-offering"
(vii. 22-27) it is repeated with added explanation
and solemn warning, thus: "And the Lord spake unto
Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, saying,
Ye shall eat no manner of fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of
goat. And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and
the fat of that which is torn with beasts, may be used for
any other service: but ye shall in no wise eat of it. For
whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer
an offering made by fire unto the Lord, even the soul that
eateth it shall be cut off from his people. And ye shall
eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl or of beast,
in any of your dwellings. Whosoever it be that eateth
any blood, that soul shall be cut off from his people."</p>

<p>From which it appears that this prohibition of the
eating of fat referred only to the fat of such beasts as
were used for sacrifice. With these, however, the law
was absolute, whether the animal was presented for
sacrifice, or only slain for food. It held good with
regard to these animals, even when, because of the
manner of their death, they could not be used for sacrifice.
In such cases, though the fat might be used for
other purposes, still it must not be used for food.</p>

<p>The prohibition of the blood as food appears from xvii.
10 to have been absolutely universal; it is said, "Whatsoever
man there be of the house of Israel, or of the
strangers that sojourn among them, that eateth any manner
of blood, I will set My face against that soul that
eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people."</p>

<p>The reason for the prohibition of the eating of blood,
whether in the case of the sacrificial feasts of the peace-offerings
or on other occasions, is given (xvii. 11, 12),
in these words: "For the life of the flesh is in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to
make atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that
maketh atonement by reason of the life. Therefore I
said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall
eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth
among you eat blood."</p>

<p>And the prohibition is then extended to include not
only the blood of animals which were used upon the
altar, but also such as were taken in hunting, thus
(ver. 13): "And whatsoever man there be of the
children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn
among them, which taketh in hunting any beast or fowl
that may be eaten, he shall pour out the blood thereof,
and cover it with dust," as something of peculiar sanctity;
and then the reason previously given is repeated
with emphasis (ver. 14): "For as to the life of all flesh,
the blood thereof is all one with the life thereof: therefore
I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eat the
blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all flesh is
the blood thereof; whosoever eateth it shall be cut off."</p>

<p>And since, when an animal died from natural causes,
or through being torn of a beast, the blood would be
drawn from the flesh either not at all or but imperfectly,
as further guarding against the possibility of eating
blood, it is ordered (vv. 15, 16) that he who does this shall
be held unclean: "Every soul that eateth that which
dieth of itself, or that which is torn of beasts, whether he
be home-born or a stranger, he shall wash his clothes, and
bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.
But if he wash them not nor bathe his flesh, then he
shall bear his iniquity."</p>

<p>These passages explicitly state the reason for the
prohibition by God of the use of blood for food to be
the fact that, as the vehicle of the life, it has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
appointed by Him as the means of expiation for sin
upon the altar. And the reason for the prohibition of
the fat is similar; namely, its appropriation for God
upon the altar, as in the peace-offerings, the sin-offerings,
and the guilt-offerings; "all the fat is the Lord's."</p>

<p>Thus the Israelite, by these two prohibitions, was to
be continually reminded, so often as he partook of his
daily food, of two things: by the one, of atonement by
the blood as the only ground of acceptance; and by
the other, of God's claim on the man redeemed by the
blood, for the consecration of his best. Not only so,
but by the frequent repetition, and still more by the
heavy penalty attached to the violation of these laws,
he was reminded of the exceeding importance that
these two things had in the mind of God. If he eat
the blood of any animal claimed by God for the altar,
he should be cut off from his people; that is, outlawed,
and cut off from all covenant privilege as a citizen of
the kingdom of God in Israel. And even though the
blood were that of the beast taken in the chase, still
ceremonial purification was required as the condition
of resuming his covenant position.</p>

<p>Nothing, doubtless, seems to most Christians of our
day more remote from practical religion than these
regulations touching the fat and the blood, which are
brought before us with such fulness in the law of the
peace-offering and elsewhere. And yet nothing is of
more present-day importance in this law than the principles
which underlie these regulations. For as with
type, so with antitype. No less essential to the admission
of the sinful man into that blessed fellowship with
a reconciled God, which the peace-offering typified, is
the recognition of the supreme sanctity of the precious
sacrificial blood of the Lamb of God; no less essential<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
to the life of happy communion with God, is the ready
consecration of the best fruit of our life to Him.</p>

<p>Surely, both of these, and especially the first, are
truths for our time. For no observing man can fail to
recognise the very ominous fact that a constantly increasing
number, even of professed preachers of the
Gospel, in so many words refuse to recognise the place
which propitiatory blood has in the Gospel of Christ,
and to admit its pre-eminent sanctity as consisting in
this, that it was given on the altar to make atonement
for our souls. Nor has the present generation outgrown
the need of the other reminder touching the
consecration of the best to the Lord. How many there
are, comfortable, easy-going Christians, whose principle&mdash;if
one might speak in the idiom of the Mosaic law&mdash;would
rather seem to be, ever to give the lean to God,
and keep the fat, the best fruit of their life and activity,
for themselves! Such need to be most urgently and
solemnly reminded that in spirit the warning against the
eating of the blood and the fat is in full force. It was
written of such as should break this law, "that soul
shall be cut off from his people." And so in the
Epistle to the Hebrews (x. 26-29) we find one of its
most solemn warnings directed to those who "count
this blood of the covenant," the blood of Christ, "an
unholy (<em>i.e.</em>, common) thing;" as exposed by this, their
undervaluation of the sanctity of the blood, to a "sorer
punishment" than overtook him that "set at nought
Moses' law," even the retribution of Him who said,
"Vengeance is Mine; I will repay, saith the Lord."</p>

<p>And so in this law of the peace-offerings, which
ordains the conditions of the holy feast of fellowship
with a reconciled God, we find these two things made
fundamental in the symbolism: full recognition of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
sanctity of the blood as that which atones for the soul;
and the full consecration of the redeemed and pardoned
soul to the Lord. So was it in the symbol; and so
shall it be when the sacrificial feast shall at last receive
its most complete fulfilment in the communion of the
redeemed with Christ in glory. There will be no differences
of opinion then and there, either as to the
transcendent value of that precious blood which made
atonement, or as to the full consecration which such a
redemption requires from the redeemed.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Thank-Offerings, Vows, and Freewill-Offerings.</span></p>

<p class="center">vii. 11-21.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace-offerings which one
shall offer unto the Lord. If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then
he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes
mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes
mingled with oil, of fine flour soaked. With cakes of leavened bread
he shall offer his oblation with the sacrifice of his peace-offerings for
thanksgiving. And of it he shall offer one out of each oblation for an
heave-offering unto the Lord; it shall be the priest's that sprinkleth
the blood of the peace-offerings. And the flesh of the sacrifice of his
peace-offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten on the day of his
oblation; he shall not leave any of it until the morning. But if the
sacrifice of his oblation be a vow, or a freewill offering, it shall be
eaten on the day that he offereth his sacrifice: and on the morrow
that which remaineth of it shall be eaten: but that which remaineth
of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire.
And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings be eaten
on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed
unto him that offereth it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that
eateth of it shall bear his iniquity. And the flesh that toucheth any
unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire. And as
for the flesh, everyone that is clean shall eat thereof: but the soul
that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, that pertain
unto the Lord, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be
cut off from his people. And when any one shall touch any unclean
thing, the uncleanness of man, or an unclean beast, or any unclean
abomination, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offerings,
that soul shall be cut off from his people."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>According to this supplemental section on the law of
the peace-offerings, these were of three kinds; namely,
"sacrifices of thanksgiving," "vows," and "freewill-offerings."
The first were offered in token of gratitude
for mercies received; as in Psalm cxvi. 16, 17, where
we read: "Thou hast loosed my bonds; I will offer to
Thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving." The second, like
these, were offered also in grateful return for prayer
answered and mercy received, but with the difference
that they were promised before, upon the condition of
the prayer for mercy being granted. Lastly, the freewill-offerings
were those which had no special occasion,
but were merely the spontaneous expression of the
love of the offerer to God, and his desire to live in
friendship and fellowship with Him. It is apparently
these freewill-offerings that we are to recognise in the
many instances recorded where the peace-offering was
presented in connection with supplication for special
help and favour from God; as, <em>e.g.</em>, when (Judges xx. 26)
Israel supplicated mercy from God after their disastrous
defeat in the civil war with the tribe of Benjamin; and
when David entreated the Lord (2 Sam. xxiv. 25) for
the staying of the plague in Israel.</p>

<p>With not only the thank-offering, but all peace-offerings,
as is clear from Numb. xv. 2-4, a full meal-offering,
consisting of three kinds of unleavened cakes,
was to be offered, of each of which, one was to be
presented as a heave-offering, with the heave-shoulder
of the sacrifice, to the Lord (vii. 12). For the sacrificial
feast, in which the offerer, his family, and friends were
to partake, he was also to bring cakes of leavened
bread, which, however, though eaten before God by the
offerer, might not be presented unto God for a heave-offering,
nor come upon the altar (ver. 13).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>From what we have already seen, the spiritual meaning
of this will be clear. Thus in symbol the Israelite
offered unto God, with his life, the fruit of the labour
of his hands, in gratitude to Him, and expressed his
happy consciousness of friendship and fellowship with
God through atonement, by feasting before Him. The
leavened bread is offered simply, as Bähr suggests, as
the usual accompaniment to a feast; though regard is
still had to the fact, never once forgotten in Holy Scripture,
that leaven is nevertheless an element and symbol
of corruption; so that however the reconciled Israelite
may eat his leavened bread before God, yet it cannot be
allowed to come upon the altar of the Most Holy One.</p>

<p>Two slight differences appear in the ritual for the
different kinds of peace-offerings. First, in the case
of the freewill-offering, a single exception is allowed
to the general rule that the victim must be without
blemish, in the permission to offer what, otherwise
perfect, might have "anything superfluous or lacking"
in its parts (xxii. 23); a circumstance which could not
affect its fitness as the symbol of spiritual food. For
a vow (and, we may infer, for a thank-offering also)
such a victim, however, could not be offered; evidently
because it would seem peculiarly unsuitable, where the
object of the offering was to make in some sense a
return for the always perfect and most gracious gifts
of God, that anything else than the absolutely perfect
should be offered. In the case of the thank-offering,
again, an exception is made to the general regulation
permitting the eating of the offering on the first and
second days, requiring that all be eaten on the day that
it is presented, or else be burnt with fire (vii. 15).
We need seek for no spiritual meaning in this. A
sufficient reason for this special restriction in this case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
is probably to be found in the consideration that as
this was the most common variety of the offering, there
was the most danger that the flesh, by some oversight,
might be kept too long. The flesh of the victim offered
to God, the type of the Victim of Calvary, must on no
account be allowed to see corruption; and to this end
every needed precaution must be taken, that by no
chance it shall remain unconsumed on the third day.</p>

<p>It is easy to connect the special characteristics of
these several varieties of the peace-offering with the
great Antitype. So may we use Him as our thank-offering;
for what more fitting as an expression of
gratitude and love to God for mercies received, than
renewed and special fellowship with Him through
feeding upon Christ as the slain Lamb? So also
we may thus use Christ in our vows; as when, supplicating
mercy, we promise and engage that if our prayer
be heard we will renewedly consecrate our service to
the Lord, as in the meal-offering, and anew enter into
life-giving fellowship with Him through feeding by
faith on the flesh of the Lord. And it is beautifully
hinted in the permission of the use of leaven in this
feast of the peace-offering, that while the work of the
believer, as presented to God in grateful acknowledgment
of His mercies, is ever affected with the taint of
his native corruption, so that it cannot come upon the
altar where satisfaction is made for sin, yet God is
graciously pleased, for the sake of the great Sacrifice,
to accept such imperfect service offered to Him, and
make it in turn a blessing to us, as we offer it in His
presence, rejoicing in the work of our hands before Him.</p>

<p>But there was one condition without which the Israelite
could not have communion with God in the peace-offering.
He must be clean! even as the flesh of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
peace-offering must be clean also. There must be in
him nothing which should interrupt covenant fellowship
with God; as nothing in the type which should
make it an unfit symbol of the Antitype. For it was
ordered (vii. 19-21), as regards every possible occasion
of uncleanness, thus: "The flesh that toucheth any
unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with
fire. As for the flesh, every one that is clean shall eat
thereof; but the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice
of peace-offerings, that pertain unto the Lord, having
his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off
from his people. And when any one shall touch any
unclean thing, the uncleanness of man, or an unclean
beast, or any unclean abomination, and eat of the flesh
of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, that soul shall be cut
off from his people."</p>

<p>In such cases, he must first go and purify himself,
as provided in the law; and then, and then only,
presume to come to eat before the Lord. And so
Israel was ever impressively reminded that he who
would have fellowship with God, and eat in happy
fellowship with Him at His table, must keep himself
pure. So by the spirit of these commands are we no
less warned that we take not encouragement from God's
grace, in providing for us the flesh of the Lamb as our
food, to be careless in walk and life. If we will use
Christ as our peace-offering, we must keep ourselves
"unspotted from the world;" must hate "even the
garment spotted by the flesh," remembering ever that
it is written in the New Testament (1 Peter i. 15, 16),
with direct reference to the typical law of Leviticus:
"As He which called you is holy, be ye yourselves
also holy in all manner of living; because it is written,
Ye shall be holy; for I am holy."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<h3><em>THE SIN-OFFERING.</em></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lev.</span> iv. 1-35.</p>


<p>Both in the burnt-offering and in the peace-offering,
Israel was taught, as we are, that all
consecration and all fellowship with God must begin
with, and ever depends upon, atonement made for sin.
But this was not the dominant thought in either of
these offerings; neither did the atonement, as made
in these, have reference to particular acts of sin. For
such, these offerings were never prescribed. They
remind us therefore of the necessity of atonement,
not so much for what we do or fail to do, as for what
we are.</p>

<p>But the sin even of true believers, whether then or
now, is more than sin of nature. The true Israelite
was liable to be overtaken in some overt act of sin;
and for all such cases was ordained, in this section
of the law (iv. 1-v. 13), the sin-offering; an offering
which should bring out into sole and peculiar prominence
the thought revealed in other sacrifices more imperfectly,
that in order to pardon of sin, there must be expiation.
There was indeed a limitation to the application of this
offering; for if a man, in those days, sinned wilfully,
presumptuously, stubbornly, or, as the phrase is, "with
a high hand," there was no provision made in the law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
for his restoration to covenant standing. "He that
despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or
three witnesses;" he was "cut off from his people."
But for sins of a lesser grade, such as resulted not
from a spirit of wilful rebellion against God, but were
mitigated in their guilt by various reasons, especially
ignorance, rashness, or inadvertence, God made provision,
in a typical way, for their removal by means of
the atonement of the sin- and the guilt-offerings. By
means of these, accompanied also with full restitution
of the wrong done, when such restitution was possible,
the guilty one might be restored in those days to his
place as an accepted citizen of the kingdom of God.</p>

<p>No part of the Levitical law is more full of deep,
heart-searching truth than the law of the sin-offering.
First of all, it is of consequence to observe that the
sins for which this chief atoning sacrifice was appointed,
were, for the most part, sins of ignorance. For so runs
the general statement with which this section opens
(ver. 2): "If any one shall sin unwittingly, in any of
the things which the Lord hath commanded not to be
done, and shall do any of them." And to these are
afterwards added sins committed through rashness,
the result rather of heat and hastiness of spirit than
of deliberate purpose of sin; as, for instance, in chap.
v. 4: "Whatsoever it be that a man shall utter rashly
with an oath, and it be hid from him." Besides these,
in the same section (vv. 1-4) as also in all the cases
mentioned under the guilt-offering, and the special
instance of a wrong done to a slave-girl (xix. 21), a
number of additional offences are mentioned which all
seem to have their special palliation, not indeed in the
ignorance of the sinner, but in the nature of the acts
themselves, as admitting of reparation. For all such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
it was also ordained that the offender should bring a
sin- (or a guilt-) offering, and that by this, atonement
being made for him, his sin might be forgiven.</p>

<p>All this must have brought before Israel, and is
meant to bring before us, the absolute equity of God
in dealing with His creatures. We think often of His
stern justice in that He so unfailingly takes note of
every sin. But here we may learn also to observe His
equity in that He notes no less carefully every circumstance
that may palliate our sin. We thankfully recognise
in these words the spirit of Him of whom it was
said (Heb. v. 2, marg.) that in the days of His flesh
He could "reasonably bear with the ignorant;" and
who said concerning those who know not their Master's
will and do it not (Luke xii. 48), that their "stripes"
shall be "few;" and who, again, with equal justice
and mercy, said of His disciples' fault in Gethsemane
(Matt. xxvi. 41), "The spirit indeed is willing, but
the flesh is weak." We do well to note this. For in
these days we hear it often charged against the holy
religion of Christ, that it represents God as essentially
and horribly unjust in consigning all unbelievers to one
and the same unvarying punishment, the eternal lake
of fire; and as thus making no difference between those
who have sinned against the utmost light and knowledge,
wilfully and inexcusably, and those who may
have sinned through ignorance, or weakness of the
flesh. To such charges as these we have simply to
answer that neither in the Old Testament nor in the
New is God so revealed. We may come back to this
book of Leviticus, and declare that even in those days
when law reigned, and grace and love were less clearly
revealed than now, God made a difference, a great
difference, between some sins and others; He visited,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
no doubt, wilful and defiant sin with condign punishment;
but, on the other hand, no less justly than
mercifully, He considered also every circumstance
which could lessen guilt, and ordained a gracious
provision for expiation and forgiveness. The God
revealed in Leviticus, like the God revealed in the
Gospel, the God "with whom we have to do," is then
no hard and unreasonable tyrant, but a most just and
equitable King. He is no less the Most Just, that He
is the Most Holy; but, rather, because He is most
holy, is He therefore most just. And because God is
such a God, in the New Testament also it is plainly
said that ignorance, as it extenuates guilt, shall also
ensure mitigation of penalty; and in the Old Testament,
that while he who sins presumptuously and with a high
hand against God, shall "die without mercy under two
or three witnesses," on the other hand, he who sins
unwittingly, or in some sudden rash impulse, doing
that of which he afterward truly repents; or who,
again, has sinned, if knowingly, still in such a way
as admits of some adequate reparation of the wrong,&mdash;all
these things shall be judged palliation of his
guilt; and if he confess his sin, and make all possible
reparation for it, then, if he present a sin- or a guilt-offering,
atonement may therewith be made, and the
sinner be forgiven.</p>

<p>This then is the first thing which the law concerning
the sin-offering brings before us: it calls our attention
to the fact that the heavenly King and Judge of men is
righteous in all His ways, and therefore will ever make
all the allowance that strict justice and righteousness
demand, for whatever may in any way palliate our guilt.</p>

<p>But none the less for this do we need also to heed
another intensely practical truth which the law of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
sin-offering brings before us: namely, that while ignorance
or other circumstances may palliate guilt, they do
not and cannot nullify it. We may have sinned without
a suspicion that we were sinning, but here we are
taught that there can be no pardon without a sin-offering.
We may have sinned through weakness or
sudden passion, but still sin is sin, and we must have
a sin-offering before we can be forgiven.</p>

<p>We may observe, in passing, the bearing of this
teaching of the law on the question so much discussed
in our day, as to the responsibility of the heathen for
the sins which they commit through ignorance. In
so far as their ignorance is not wilful and avoidable,
it doubtless greatly diminishes their guilt; and the
Lord Himself has said of such that their stripes shall
be few. And yet more than this He does not say.
Except we are prepared to cast aside the teaching alike
of Leviticus and the Gospels, it is certain that their
ignorance does not cancel their guilt. That the ignorance
of any one concerning moral law can secure his
exemption from the obligation to suffer for his sin, is
not only against the teaching of all Scripture, but is
also contradicted by all that we can see about us of
God's government of the world. For when does God
ever suspend the operation of physical laws, because
the man who violates them does not know that he is
breaking them? And so also, will we but open our
eyes, we may see that it is with moral law. The
heathen, for example, are ignorant of many moral laws;
but do they therefore escape the terrible consequences
of their law-breaking, even in this present life, where
we can see for ourselves how God is dealing with
them? And is there any reason to think it will be
different in the life hereafter?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>Does it seem harsh that men should be punished
even for sins of ignorance, and pardon be impossible,
even for these, without atonement? It would not seem
so, would men but think more deeply. For beyond all
question, the ignorance of men as to the fundamental
law of God, to love Him with all the heart, and our
neighbour as ourselves, which is the sum of all law,
has its reason, not in any lack of light, but in the evil
heart of man, who everywhere and always, until he is
regenerated, loves self more than he loves God. The
words of Christ (John iii. 20) apply: "He that doeth
evil cometh not to the light;" not even to the light
of nature.</p>

<p>And yet, one who should look only at this chapter
might rejoin to this, that the Israelite was only obliged
to bring a sin-offering, when afterward he came to the
knowledge of his sin as sin; but, in case he never
came to that knowledge, was not then his sin passed
by without an atoning sacrifice? To this question, the
ordinance which we find in chapter xvi. is the decisive
answer. For therein it was provided that once every
year a very solemn sin-offering should be offered by
the high priest, for all the multitudinous sins of Israel,
which were not atoned for in the special sin-offerings
of each day. Hence it is strictly true that no sin in
Israel was ever passed over without either penalty or
shedding of blood. And so the law keeps it ever
before us that our unconsciousness of sinning does not
alter the fact of sin, or the fact of guilt, nor remove the
obligation to suffer because of sin; and that even the
sin of which we are quite ignorant, interrupts man's
peace with God and harmony with him. Thus the
best of us must take as our own the words of the
Apostle Paul (1 Cor. iv. 4, R.V.): "I know nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
against myself; yet am I not hereby justified; He that
judgeth me is the Lord."</p>

<p>Nor does the testimony of this law end here. We
are by it taught that the guilt of sins unrecognised as
sins at the time of their committal, cannot be cancelled
merely by penitent confession when they become known.
Confession must indeed be made, according to the law,
as one condition of pardon, but, besides this, the guilty
man must bring his sin-offering.</p>

<p>What truths can be more momentous and vital than
these! Can any one say, in the light of such a revelation,
that all in this ancient law of the sin-offering
is now obsolete, and of no concern to us? For how
many there are who are resting all their hopes for
the future on the fact that they have sinned, if at all,
then ignorantly; or that they "have meant to do
right;" or that they have confessed the sin when it
was known, and have been very sorry. And yet, if
this law teach anything, it teaches that this is a fatal
mistake, and that such hopes rest on a foundation of
sand. If we would be forgiven, we must indeed confess
our sin and we must repent; but this is not enough.
We must have a sin-offering; we must make use of
the great Sin-Offering which that of Leviticus typified;
we must tell our compassionate High Priest how in
ignorance, or in the rashness of some unholy, over-mastering
impulse, we sinned, and commit our case to
Him, that He may apply the precious blood in our
behalf with God.</p>

<p>It is a third impressive fact, that after we include all
the cases for which the sin-offering was provided, there
still remain many sins for the forgiveness of which
no provision was made. It was ordered elsewhere, for
instance (Numb. xxxv. 31-33) that no satisfaction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
should be taken for the life of a murderer. He might
confess and bewail his sin, and be never so sorry, but
there was no help for him; he must die the death. So
was it also with blasphemy; so with adultery, and
with many other crimes. This exclusion of so many
cases from the merciful provision of the typical offering
had a meaning. It was intended, not only to emphasise
to the conscience the aggravated wickedness of such
crimes, but also to develop in Israel the sense of need
for a more adequate provision, a better sacrifice than
any the Levitical law could offer; blood which should
cleanse, not merely in a ceremonial and sacramental
way, but really and effectively; and not only from some
sins, but from all sins.</p>

<p>The law of the sin-offering is introduced by phraseology
different from that which is used in the case of
the preceding offerings. In the case of each of these,
the language used implies that the Israelites were
familiar with the offering before its incorporation into
the Levitical sacrificial system. The sin-offering, on
the other hand, is introduced as a new thing. And
such, indeed, it was. While, as we have seen, each of
the offerings before ordered had been known and used,
both by the Shemitic and the other nations, since
long before the days of Moses, before this time there
is no mention anywhere, in Scripture or out of it, of a
sacrifice corresponding to the sin- or the guilt-offering.
The significance of this fact is apparent so soon as we
observe what was the distinctive conception of the sin-offering,
as contrasted with the other offerings. Without
question, it was the idea of expiation of guilt by
the sacrifice of a substituted victim. This idea, as
we have seen, was indeed not absent from the other
bloody offerings; but in those its place was secondary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
and subordinate. In the ritual of the sin-offering, on
the contrary, this idea was brought out into almost
solitary prominence;&mdash;sin pardoned on the ground of
expiation made through the presentation to God of the
blood of an innocent victim.</p>

<p>The introduction of this new sacrifice, then, marked
the fact that the spiritual training of man, of Israel in
particular, herewith entered on a new stadium; which
was to be distinguished by the development, in a degree
to that time without a precedent, of the sense of sin and
of guilt, and the need therefore of atonement in order
to pardon. This need had not indeed been unfelt
before; but never in any ritual had it received so
full expression. Not only is the idea of expiation by
the shedding of blood almost the only thought represented
in the ritual of the offering, but in the order
afterward prescribed for the different sacrifices, the sin-offering,
in all cases where others were offered, must
go before them all; before the burnt-offering, the meal-offering,
the peace-offering. So again, this new law
insists upon expiation even for those sins which have
the utmost possible palliation and excuse, in that at the
time of their committal the sinner knew them not as
sins; and thus teaches that even these so fatally
interrupt fellowship with the holy God, that only such
expiation can restore the broken harmony. What a
revelation was this law, of the way in which God
regards sin! and of the extremity, in consequence, of
the sinner's need!</p>

<p>Most instructive, too, were the circumstances under
which this new offering, with such a special purpose,
embodying such a revelation of the extent of
human guilt and responsibility, was first ordained. For
its appointment followed quickly upon the tremendous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
revelation of the consuming holiness of God upon
Mount Sinai. It was in the light of the holy mount,
quaking and flaming with fire, that the eye of Moses
was opened to receive from God this revelation of His
will, and he was moved by the Holy Ghost to appoint for
Israel, in the name of Jehovah, an offering which should
differ from all other offerings in this&mdash;that it should hold
forth to Israel, in solitary and unprecedented prominence,
this one thought, that "without shedding of blood
there is no remission of sin," not even of sins which
are not known as sins at the time of their committal.</p>

<p>Our own generation, and even the Church of to-day,
greatly needs to consider the significance of this fact.
The spirit of our age is much more inclined to magnify
the greatness and majesty of man, than the infinite
greatness and holy majesty of God. Hence many talk
lightly of atonement, and cannot admit its necessity to
the pardon of sin. But can we doubt, with this narrative
before us, that if men saw God more clearly as He
is, there would be less talk of this kind? When Moses
saw God on Mount Sinai, he came down to ordain a
sin-offering even for sins of ignorance! And nothing
is more certain, as a fact of human experience in all
ages, than this, that the more clearly men have perceived
the unapproachable holiness and righteousness
of God, the more clearly they have seen that expiation
of our sins, even of our sins of ignorance, by atoning
blood, is the most necessary and fundamental of all
conditions, if we will have pardon of sin and peace with
a Holy God.</p>

<p>Man is indeed slow to learn this lesson of the sin-offering.
It is quite too humbling and abasing to
our natural, self-satisfied pride, to be readily received.
This is strikingly illustrated by the fact that it is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
until late in Israel's history that the sin-offering is
mentioned in the sacred record; while even from that
first mention till the Exile, it is mentioned only rarely.
This fact is indeed often in our day held up as evidence
that the sin-offering was not of Mosaic origin, but a
priestly invention of much later days. But the fact is
quite as well accounted for by the spiritual obtuseness
of Israel. The whole narrative shows that they were
a people hard of heart and slow to learn the solemn
lessons of Sinai; slow to apprehend the holiness of
God, and the profound spiritual truth set forth in the
institution of the sin-offering. And yet it was not
wholly unobserved, nor did every individual fail to
learn its lessons. Nowhere in heathen literature do
we find such a profound conviction of sin, such a sense
of responsibility even for sins of ignorance, as in some
of the earliest Psalms, and the earlier prophets. The
self-excusing which so often marks the heathen confessions,
finds no place in the confessions of those
Old Testament believers, brought up under the moral
training of that Sinaitic law which had the sin-offering
as its supreme expression on this subject. "Search me,
O God, and try my heart; and see if there be in me
any wicked way" (Psalm cxxxix. 23, 24); "Cleanse
Thou me from secret sins" (Psalm xix. 12); "Against
Thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in Thy
sight" (Psalm li. 4). Such words as these, with many
other like prayers and confessions, bear witness to the
deepening sense of sin, till at the last the sin-offering
teaches, as its own chief lesson, its own inadequacy for
the removal of guilt, in those words of the prophetic
Psalm, (xl. 6) from the man who mourned iniquities
more than the hairs of his head: "Sin-offering Thou
hast not required."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>But, according to the epistle to the Hebrews, we are
to regard David in these words, speaking by the Holy
Ghost, as typifying Christ; for we thus read, x. 5-10:
"When He cometh into the world He saith, Sacrifice
and offering Thou wouldest not, but a body didst Thou
prepare for Me; in whole burnt-offerings and sin-offerings
Thou hadst no pleasure. Then said I, Lo, I
am come (in the roll of the book it is written of Me)
to do Thy will, O God."</p>

<p>Which words are then expounded thus: "Saying
above, Sacrifices and offerings, and whole burnt-offerings
and sacrifices for sin Thou wouldest not, neither hadst
pleasure therein (the which are offered according to the
law); then hath He said, Lo, I am come to do Thy will.
He taketh away the first that He may establish the
second. By which will we have been sanctified through
the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all."</p>

<p>And so, as the deepest lesson of the sin-offering, we
are taught to see in it a type and prophecy of Christ,
as the true and one eternally effectual sin-offering for
the sins of His people; who, Himself at once High
Priest and Victim, offering Himself for us, perfects us
for ever, as the old sin-offering could not, giving us
therefore "boldness to enter into the holy place by the
blood of Jesus." May we all have grace by faith to
receive and learn this deepest lesson of this ordinance,
and thus in the law of the sin-offering discover Him
who in His person and work became the Fulfiller of
this law.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Graded Responsibility.</span></p>

<p class="center">iv. 3, 13, 14, 22, 23, 27, 28.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If the anointed priest shall sin so as to bring guilt on the people;
then let him offer for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
without blemish unto the Lord for a sin-offering.... And if the
whole congregation of Israel shall err, and the thing be hid from the
eyes of the assembly, and they have done any of the things which
the Lord hath commanded not to be done, and are guilty; when the
sin wherein they have sinned is known, then the assembly shall offer
a young bullock for a sin-offering, and bring it before the tent of
meeting.... When a ruler sinneth, and doeth unwittingly any one
of all the things which the Lord his God hath commanded not to be
done, and is guilty; if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, be made known
to him, he shall bring for his oblation a goat, a male without blemish....
And if any one of the common people sin unwittingly, in doing
any of the things which the Lord hath commanded not to be done,
and be guilty; if his sin, which he hath sinned, be made known to
him, then he shall bring for his oblation a goat, a female without
blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned."</p></blockquote>

<p>The law concerning the sin-offering is given in
four sections, of which the last, again, is divided into
two parts, separated by the division of the chapter.
These four sections respectively treat of&mdash;first, the law
of the sin-offering for the "anointed priest" (vv.
3-12); secondly, the law for the offering for the whole
congregation (vv. 13-21); thirdly, that for a ruler
(vv. 22-26); and lastly, the law for an offering made
by a private person, one of "the common people"
(iv. 27-v. 16). In this last section we have, first, the
general law (iv. 27-35), and then are added (v. 1-16)
special prescriptions having reference to various circumstances
under which a sin-offering should be offered by
one of the people. Under this last head are mentioned
first, as requiring a sin-offering, in addition to sins of
ignorance or inadvertence, which only were mentioned
in the preceding chapter, also sins due to rashness or
weakness (vv. 1-4); and then are appointed, in the
second place, certain variations in the material of the
offering, allowed out of regard to the various ability of
different offerers (vv. 5-16).</p>

<p>In the law as given in chap. iv., it is to be observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
that the selection of the victim prescribed is determined
by the position of the persons who might have occasion
to present the offering. For the whole congregation,
the victim must be a bullock, the most valuable of all;
for the high priest, as the highest religious official of
the nation, and appointed also to represent them before
God, it must also be a bullock. For the civil ruler, the
offering must be a he-goat&mdash;an offering of a value less
than that of the victim ordered for the high priest,
but greater than that of those which were prescribed
for the common people. For these, a variety of offerings
were appointed, according to their several ability.
If possible, it must be a female goat or lamb, or, if the
worshipper could not bring that, then two turtle doves,
or two young pigeons. If too poor to bring even this
small offering, then it was appointed that, as a substitute
for the bloody offering, he might bring an offering
of fine flour, without oil or frankincense, to be burnt
upon the altar.</p>

<p>Evidently, then, the choice of the victim was determined
by two considerations: first, the rank of the
person who sinned, and, secondly, his ability. As
regards the former point, the law as to the victim for
the sin-offering was this: the higher the theocratic
rank of the sinning person might be, the more costly
offering he must bring. No one can well miss of perceiving
the meaning of this. The guilt of any sin in
God's sight is proportioned to the rank and station of
the offender. What truth could be of more practical
and personal concern to all than this?</p>

<p>In applying this principle, the law of the sin-offering
teaches, first, that the guilt of any sin is the heaviest,
when it is committed by one who is placed in a position
of religious authority. For this graded law is headed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
by the case of the sin of the anointed priest, that is,
the high priest, the highest functionary in the nation.</p>

<p>We read (ver. 3): "If the anointed priest shall sin so
as to bring guilt on the people, then let him offer for
his sin which he hath committed, a young bullock without
blemish, unto the Lord, for a sin-offering."</p>

<p>That is, the high priest, although a single individual,
if he sin, must bring as large and valuable an offering
as is required from the whole congregation. For this
law there are two evident reasons. The first is found in
the fact that in Israel the high priest represented before
God the entire nation. When he sinned it was as if
the whole nation sinned in him. So it is said that
by his sin he "brings guilt on the people"&mdash;a very
weighty matter. And this suggests a second reason
for the costly offering that was required from him.
The consequences of the sin of one in such a high
position of religious authority must, in the nature of the
case, be much more serious and far-reaching than in the
case of any other person.</p>

<p>And here we have another lesson as pertinent to
our time as to those days. As the high priest, so, in
modern time, the bishop, minister, or elder, is ordained
as an officer in matters of religion, to act for and with
men in the things of God. For the proper administration
of this high trust, how indispensable that such a
one shall take heed to maintain unbroken fellowship
with God! Any shortcoming here is sure to impair by
so much the spiritual value of his own ministrations
for the people to whom he ministers. And this evil
consequence of any unfaithfulness of his is the more
certain to follow, because, of all the members of the
community, his example has the widest and most effective
influence; in whatever that example be bad or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
defective, it is sure to do mischief in exact proportion
to his exalted station. If then such a one sin, the case
is very grave, and his guilt proportionately heavy.</p>

<p>This very momentous fact is brought before us in
an impressive way in the New Testament, where, in
the epistles to the Seven Churches of Asia (Rev. ii., iii.),
it is "the angel of the church," the presiding officer of
the church in each city, who is held responsible for the
spiritual state of those committed to his charge. No
wonder that the Apostle James wrote (James iii. 1):
"Be not many teachers, my brethren, knowing that we
shall receive heavier judgment." Well may every true-hearted
minister of Christ's Church tremble, as here in
the law of the sin-offering he reads how the sin of the
officer of religion may bring guilt, not only on himself,
but also "on the whole people"! Well may he cry
out with the Apostle Paul (2 Cor. ii. 16): "Who is
sufficient for these things?" and, like him, beseech
those to whom he ministers, "Brethren, pray for us!"</p>

<p>With the sin of the high priest is ranked that of the
congregation, or the collective nation. It is written
(vv. 13, 14): "If the whole congregation of Israel
shall err, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the
assembly, and they have done any one of the things
which the Lord hath commanded not to be done, and
are guilty, then the assembly shall offer a young
bullock for a sin-offering."</p>

<p>Thus Israel was taught by this law, as we are, that
responsibility attaches not only to each individual
person, but also to associations of individuals in their
corporate character, as nations, communities, and&mdash;we
may add&mdash;all Societies and Corporations, whether
secular or religious. Let us emphasise it to our own
consciences, as another of the fundamental lessons of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
this law: there is individual sin; there is also such a
thing as a sin by "the whole congregation." In other
words, God holds nations, communities&mdash;in a word, all
associations and combinations of men for whatever
purpose, no less under obligation in their corporate
capacity to keep His law than as individuals, and will
count them guilty if they break it, even through
ignorance.</p>

<p>Never has a generation needed this reminder more
than our own. The political and social principles which,
since the French Revolution in the end of the last century,
have been, year by year, more and more generally
accepted among the nations of Christendom, are everywhere
tending to the avowed or practical denial of this
most important truth. It is a maxim ever more and
more extensively accepted as almost axiomatic in our
modern democratic communities, that religion is wholly
a concern of the individual; and that a nation or community,
as such, should make no distinction between
various religions as false or true, but maintain an
absolute neutrality, even between Christianity and
idolatry, or theism and atheism. It should take little
thought to see that this modern maxim stands in direct
opposition to the principle assumed in this law of the
sin-offering; namely, that a community or nation is as
truly and directly responsible to God as the individual
in the nation. But this corporate responsibility the
spirit of the age squarely denies.</p>

<p>Not that all, indeed, in our modern so-called Christian
nations have come to this. But no one will deny
that this is the mind of the vanguard of nineteenth century
liberalism in religion and politics. Many of our
political leaders in all lands make no secret of their
views on the subject. A purely secular state is everywhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
held up, and that with great plausibility and
persuasiveness, as the ideal of political government;
the goal to the attainment of which all good citizens
should unite their efforts. And, indeed, in some parts
of Christendom the complete attainment of this evil
ideal seems not far away.</p>

<p>It is not strange, indeed, to see atheists, agnostics,
and others who deny the Christian faith, maintaining this
position; but when we hear men who call themselves
Christians&mdash;in many cases, even Christian ministers&mdash;advocating,
in one form or another, governmental
neutrality in religion as the only right basis of
government, one may well be amazed. For Christians
are supposed to accept the Holy Scriptures as the law
of faith and of morals, private and public; and where
in all the Scripture will any one find such an attitude of
any nation or people mentioned, but to be condemned
and threatened with the judgment of God?</p>

<p>Will any one venture to say that this teaching of
the law of the sin-offering was only intended, like the
offering itself, for the old Hebrews? Is it not rather
the constant and most emphatic teaching of the whole
Scriptures, that God dealt with all the ancient Gentile
nations on the same principle? The history which
records the overthrow of those old nations and empires
does so, even professedly, for the express purpose of
calling the attention of men in all ages to this principle,
that God deals with all nations as under obligation to
recognise Himself as King of nations, and submit in
all things to His authority. So it was in the case of
Moab, of Ammon, of Nineveh, and Babylon; in regard
to each of which we are told, in so many words, that it
was because they refused to recognise this principle of
national responsibility to the one true God, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
brought before Israel in this part of the law of the
sin-offering, that the Divine judgment came upon them
in their utter national overthrow. How awfully plain,
again, is the language of the second Psalm on this
same subject, where it is precisely this national repudiation
of the supreme authority of God and of His
Christ, so increasingly common in our day, which is
named as the ground of the derisive judgment of God,
and is made the occasion of exhorting all nations, not
merely to belief in God, but also to the obedient
recognition of His only-begotten Son, the Messiah, as
the only possible means of escaping the future kindling
of His wrath.</p>

<p>No graver sign of our times could perhaps be named
than just this universal tendency in Christendom, in
one way or another, to repudiate that corporate responsibility
to God which is assumed as the basis of
this part of the law of the sin-offering. There can
be no worse omen for the future of an individual than
the denial of his obligations to God and to His Son,
our Saviour; and there can be no worse sign for the
future of Christendom, or of any nation in Christendom,
than the partial or entire denial of national obligation
to God and to His Christ. What it shall mean in the
end, what is the future toward which these popular
modern principles are conducting the nations, is revealed
in Scripture with startling clearness, in the warning
that the world is yet to see one who shall be in a
peculiar and eminent sense "<em>the</em> Antichrist" (1 John
ii. 18); who shall deny both the Father and Son, and
be "the Lawless One," and the "Man of Sin," in that He
shall "set Himself forth as God" (2 Thess. ii. 3-8);
to whom authority will be given "over every tribe, and
people, and tongue, and nation" (Rev. xiii. 7).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>The nation, then, as such, is held responsible to
God! So stands the law. And, therefore, in Israel,
if the nation should sin, it was ordained that they also,
like the high priest, should bring a bullock for a sin-offering,
the most costly victim that was ever prescribed.
This was so ordained, no doubt, in part because of
Israel's own priestly station as a "kingdom of priests
and a holy nation," exalted to a position of peculiar
dignity and privilege before God, that they might
mediate the blessings of redemption to all nations.
It was because of this fact that, if they sinned, their
guilt was peculiarly heavy.</p>

<p>The principle, however, is of present-day application.
Privilege is the measure of responsibility, no less now
than then, for nations as well as for individuals. Thus
national sin, on the part of the British or American
nation, or indeed with any of the so-called Christian
nations, is certainly judged by God to be a much more
evil thing than the same sin if committed, for example,
by the Chinese or Turkish nation, who have had no
such degree of Gospel light and knowledge.</p>

<p>And the law in this case evidently also implies that
sin is aggravated in proportion to its universality. It
is bad, for example, if in a community one man commit
adultery, forsaking his own wife; but it argues a condition
of things far worse when the violation of the
marriage relation becomes common; when the question
can actually be held open for discussion whether marriage,
as a permanent union between one man and one
woman, be not "a failure," as debated not long ago
in a leading London paper; and when, as in many of
the United States of America and other countries of
modern Christendom, laws are enacted for the express
purpose of legalising the violation of Christ's law of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
marriage, and thus shielding adulterers and adulteresses
from the condign punishment their crime deserves. It
is bad, again, when individuals in a State teach doctrines
subversive of morality; but it evidently argues a far
deeper depravation of morals when a whole community
unite in accepting, endowing, and upholding such in their
work.</p>

<p>Next in order comes the case of the civil ruler. For
him it was ordered: "When a ruler sinneth, and doeth
unwittingly any of the things which the Lord his God
hath commanded not to be done, and is guilty; if his
sin, wherein he hath sinned, be made known to him,
he shall bring for his oblation a goat, a male without
blemish" (ver. 22). Thus, the ruler was to bring a
victim of less value than the high-priest or the collective
congregation; but it must still be of more value
than that of a private person; for his responsibility,
if less than that of the officer of religion, is distinctly
greater than that of a man in private life.</p>

<p>And here is a lesson for modern politicians, no less
than for rulers of the olden time in Israel. While
there are many in our Parliaments and like governing
bodies in Christendom who cast their every vote with
the fear of God before their eyes, yet, if there be any
truth in the general opinion of men upon this subject,
there are many in such places who, in their voting,
have before their eyes the fear of party more than
the fear of God; and who, when a question comes
before them, first of all consider, not what would the
law of absolute righteousness, the law of God, require,
but how will a vote, one way or the other, in this
matter, be likely to affect their party? Such certainly
need to be emphatically reminded of this part of the law
of the sin-offering, which held the civil ruler specially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
responsible to God for the execution of his trust. For
so it is still; God has not abdicated His throne in
favour of the people, nor will He waive His crown-rights
out of deference to the political necessities of a party.</p>

<p>Nor is it only those who sin in this particular way
who need the reminder of their personal responsibility
to God. All need it who either are or may be called
to places of greater or less governmental responsibility;
and it is those who are the most worthy of such trust
who will be the first to acknowledge their need of this
warning. For in all times those who have been lifted
to positions of political power have been under peculiar
temptation to forget God, and become reckless of their
obligation to Him as His ministers. But under the
conditions of modern life, in many countries of Christendom,
this is true as perhaps never before. For
now it has come to pass that, in most modern communities,
those who make and execute laws hold their
tenure of office at the pleasure of a motley army of
voters, Protestants and Romanists, Jews, atheists, and
what not, a large part of whom care not the least for
the will of God in civil government, as revealed in
Holy Scripture. Under such conditions, the place of
the civil ruler becomes one of such special trial and
temptation that we do well to remember in our intercessions,
with peculiar sympathy, all who in such positions
are seeking to serve supremely, not their party,
but their God, and so best serve their country. It is no
wonder that the temptation too often to many becomes
overpowering, to silence conscience with plausible
sophistries, and to use their office to carry out in
legislation, instead of the will of God, the will of the
people, or rather, of that particular party which put
them in power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet the great principle affirmed in this law of the
sin-offering stands, and will stand for ever, and to it all
will do well to take heed; namely, that God will hold
the civil ruler responsible, and more heavily responsible
than any private person, for any sin he may commit,
and especially for any violation of law in any matter
committed to his trust. And there is abundant reason
for this. For the powers that be are ordained of God,
and in His providence are placed in authority; not as
the modern notion is, for the purpose of executing the
will of their constituents, whatever that will may be,
but rather the unchangeable will of the Most Holy God,
the Ruler of all nations, so far as revealed, concerning
the civil and social relations of men. Nor must it be
forgotten that this eminent responsibility attaches to
them, not only in their official acts, but in all their acts
as individuals. No distinction is made as to the sin
for which the ruler must bring his sin-offering, whether
public and official, or private and personal. Of whatsoever
kind the sin may be, if committed by a ruler,
God holds him specially responsible, as being a ruler;
and reckons the guilt of that sin, even if a private
offence, to be heavier than if it had been committed by
one of the common people. And this, for the evident
reason that, as in the case of the high priest, his
exalted position gives his example double influence and
effect. Thus, in all ages and all lands, a corrupt king
or nobility have made a corrupt court; and a corrupt
court or corrupt legislators are sure to demoralise all
the lower ranks of society. But however it may be
under the governments of men, under the equitable
government of the Most Holy God, high station can give
no immunity to sin. And in the day to come, when the
Great Assize is set, there will be many who in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
world stood high in authority, who will learn, in the
tremendous decisions of that day, if not before, that a
just God reckoned the guilt of their sins and crimes in
exact proportion to their rank and station.</p>

<p>Last of all, in this chapter, comes the law of the sin-offering
for one of the common people, of which the
first part is given vv. 27-35. The victim which is
appointed for those who are best able to give, a female
goat, is yet of less value than those ordered in the
cases before given; for the responsibility and guilt in
the case of such is less. The first prescription for a sin-offering
by one of the common people, is introduced by
these words:&mdash;"If any one of the common people sin
unwittingly, in doing any of the things which the Lord
hath commanded not to be done, and be guilty; if his
sin, which he hath sinned, be made known to him, then
he shall bring for his oblation a goat, a female without
blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned" (vv. 27, 28).</p>

<p>In case of his inability to bring so much as this,
offerings of lesser value are authorised in the section
following (v. 5-13), to which we shall attend hereafter.</p>

<p>Meanwhile it is suggestive to observe that this part
of the law is expanded more fully than any other part
of the law of the sin-offering. We are hereby reminded
that if none are so high as to be above the reach of
the judgment of God, but are held in that proportion
strictly responsible for their sin; so, on the other hand,
none are of station so low that their sins shall therefore
be overlooked. The common people, in all lands, are
the great majority of the population; but no one is to
imagine that, because he is a single individual, of no
importance in a multitude, he shall therefore, if he sin,
escape the Divine eye, as it were, in a crowd. Not so.
We may be of the very lowest social station; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
provision in chapter v. 11 regards the case of such
as might be so poor as that they could not even buy
two doves. Men may judge the doings of such poor
folk of little or no consequence; but not so God.
With Him is no respect of persons, either of rich or
poor. From all alike, from the anointed high priest,
who ministers in the Holy of Holies, down to the
common people, and among these, again, from the
highest down to the very lowest, poorest, and meanest
in rank, is demanded, even for a sin of ignorance, a
sin-offering for atonement.</p>

<p>What a solemn lesson we have herein concerning
the character of God! His omniscience, which not only
notes the sin of those who are in some conspicuous
position, but also each individual sin of the lowest of
the people! His absolute equity, exactly and accurately
grading responsibility for sin committed, in each case,
according to the rank and influence of him who commits
it! His infinite holiness, which cannot pass by
without expiation even the transient act or word of
rash hands or lips, not even the sin not known as sin
by the sinner; a holiness which, in a word, unchangeably
and unalterably requires, from every human being,
nothing less than absolute moral perfection like His
own!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lev.</span> iv. 4-35; v. 1-13; vi. 24-30.</p>


<p>According to the Authorised Version (v. 6, 7),
it might seem that the section, v. 1-13, referred
not to the sin-offering, but to the guilt-offering, like the
latter part of the chapter; but, as suggested in the
margin of the Revised Version, in these verses we may
properly read, instead of "guilt-offering," "for his
guilt." That the latter rendering is to be preferred is
clear when we observe that in vv. 6, 7, 9 this offering
is called a sin-offering; that, everywhere else, the
victim for the guilt-offering is a ram; and, finally, that
the estimation of a money value for the victim, which is
the most characteristic feature of the guilt-offering, is
absent from all the offerings described in these verses.
We may safely take it therefore as certain that the marginal
reading should be adopted in ver. 6, so that it
will read, "he shall bring for his guilt unto the Lord;"
and understand the section to contain a further development
of the law of the sin-offering. In the law of the
preceding chapter we have the direction for the sin-offering
as graded with reference to the rank and station
of the offerer; in this section we have the law for the
sin-offering for the common people, as graded with
reference to the ability of the offerer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>The specifications (v. 1-5) indicate several cases
under which one of the common people was required to
bring a sin-offering as the condition of forgiveness.
As an exhaustive list would be impossible, those named
are taken as illustrations. The instances selected
are significant as extending the class of offences for
which atonement could be made by a sin-offering,
beyond the limits of sins of inadvertence as given in the
previous chapter. For however some cases come under
this head, we cannot so reckon sins of rashness (ver. 4),
and still less, the failure of the witness placed under
oath to tell the whole truth as he knows it. And herein
it is graciously intimated that it is in the heart of God
to multiply His pardons; and, on condition of the
presentation of a sin-offering, to forgive also those
sins in palliation of which no such excuse as inadvertence
or ignorance can be pleaded. It is a faint
foreshadowing, in the law concerning the type, of that
which should afterward be declared concerning the
great Antitype (1 John i. 7), "The blood of Jesus ...
cleanseth from all sin."</p>

<p>When we look now at the various prescriptions regarding
the ritual of the offering which are given in
this and the foregoing chapter, it is plain that the
numerous variations from the ritual of the other sacrifices
were intended to withdraw the thought of the
sinner from all other aspects in which sacrifice might be
regarded, and centre his mind upon the one thought of
sacrifice as expiating sin, through the substitution of an
innocent life for the guilty. In many particulars, indeed,
the ritual agrees with that of the sacrifices before prescribed.
The victim must be brought by the guilty
person to be offered to God by the priest; he must, as
in other cases of bloody offerings, then lay his hand on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the head of the victim, and then (a particular not mentioned
in the other cases) he must confess the sin
which he has committed, and then and thus entrust the
victim to the priest, that he may apply its blood for
him in atonement before God. The priest then slays
the victim, and now comes that part of the ceremonial
which by its variations from the law of other offerings
is emphasised as the most central and significant in this
sacrifice.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Sprinkling of the Blood.</span></p>

<p class="center">iv. 6, 7, 16-18, 25, 30; v. 9.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of
the blood seven times before the Lord, before the veil of the sanctuary.
And the priest shall put of the blood upon the horns of the altar of
sweet incense before the Lord, which is in the tent of meeting; and
all the blood of the bullock shall he pour out at the base of the altar
of burnt offering, which is at the door of the tent of meeting....
And the anointed priest shall bring of the blood of the bullock to the
tent of meeting: and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood,
and sprinkle it seven times before the Lord, before the veil. And
he shall put of the blood upon the horns of the altar which is before
the Lord, that is in the tent of meeting, and all the blood shall he pour
out at the base of the altar of burnt offering, which is at the door of
the tent of meeting.... And the priest shall take of the blood of the
sin offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of
burnt offering, and the blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of
the altar of burnt offering.... And the priest shall take of the blood
thereof with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of
burnt offering, and all the blood thereof shall he pour out at the base
of the altar.... And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering
upon the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be drained out
at the base of the altar: it is a sin offering."</p></blockquote>

<p>In the case of the burnt-offering and of the peace-offering,
in which the idea of expiation, although not
absent, yet occupied a secondary place in their ethical
intent, it sufficed that the blood of the victim, by whomsoever
brought, be applied to the sides of the altar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
But in the sin-offering, the blood must not only be
sprinkled on the sides of the altar of burnt-offering, but,
even in the case of the common people, be applied to
the horns of the altar, its most conspicuous and, in a
sense, most sacred part. In the case of a sin committed
by the whole congregation, even this is not
enough; the blood must be brought even into the
Holy Place, be applied to the horns of the altar of
incense, and be sprinkled seven times before the Lord
before the veil which hung immediately before the mercy
seat in the Holy of Holies, the place of the Shekinah
glory. And in the great sin-offering of the high priest
once a year for the sins of all the people, yet more
was required. The blood was to be taken even within
the veil, and be sprinkled on the mercy seat itself over
the tables of the broken law.</p>

<p>These several cases, according to the symbolism of
these several parts of the tabernacle differ, in that atoning
blood is brought ever more and more nearly into
the immediate presence of God. The horns of the
altar had a sacredness above the sides; the altar of the
Holy Place before the veil, a sanctity beyond that of
the altar in the outer court; while the Most Holy Place,
where stood the ark, and the mercy-seat, was the very
place of the most immediate and visible manifestation
of Jehovah, who is often described in Holy Scripture,
with reference to the ark, the mercy-seat, and the
overhanging cherubim, as the God who "dwelleth
between the cherubim."</p>

<p>From this we may easily understand the significance
of the different prescriptions as to the blood in the case
of different classes. A sin committed by any private
individual or by a ruler, was that of one who had access
only to the outer court, where stood the altar of burnt-offering;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
for this reason, it is there that the blood must
be exhibited, and that on the most sacred and conspicuous
spot in that court, the horns of the altar where
God meets with the people. But when it was the
anointed priest that had sinned, the case was different.
In that he had a peculiar position of nearer access to
God than others, as appointed of God to minister before
Him in the Holy Place, his sin is regarded as having
defiled the Holy Place itself; and in that Holy Place
must Jehovah therefore see atoning blood ere the
priest's position before God can be re-established.</p>

<p>And the same principle required that also in the
Holy Place must the blood be presented for the sin
of the whole congregation. For Israel in its corporate
unity was "a kingdom of priests," a priestly nation;
and the priest in the Holy Place represented the nation
in that capacity. Thus because of this priestly office
of the nation, their collective sin was regarded as defiling
the Holy Place in which, through their representatives,
the priests, they ideally ministered. Hence, as
the law for the priests, so is the law for the nation. For
their corporate sin the blood must be applied, as in the
case of the priest who represented them, to the horns
of the altar in the Holy Place, whence ascended the
smoke of the incense which visibly symbolised accepted
priestly intercession, and, more than this, before the
veil itself; in other words, as near to the very mercy-seat
itself as it was permitted to the priest to go; and
it must be sprinkled there, not once, nor twice, but
seven times, in token of the re-establishment, through
the atoning blood, of God's covenant of mercy, of which,
throughout the Scripture, the number seven, the number
of sabbatic rest and covenant fellowship with God, is
the constant symbol.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>And it is not far to seek for the spiritual thought
which underlies this part of the ritual. For the tabernacle
was represented as the earthly dwelling-place, in a sense,
of God; and just as the defiling of the house of my
fellow-man may be regarded as an insult to him who
dwells in the house, so the sin of the priest and of the
priestly people is regarded as, more than that of those
outside of this relation, a special affront to the holy
majesty of Jehovah, criminal just in proportion as the
defilement approaches more nearly the innermost shrine
of Jehovah's manifestation.</p>

<p>But though Israel is at present suspended from its
priestly position and function among the nations of the
earth, the Apostle Peter (1 Peter ii. 5) reminds us that
the body of Christian believers now occupies Israel's
ancient place, being now on earth the "royal priesthood,"
the "holy nation." Hence this ritual solemnly
reminds us that the sin of a Christian is a far more
evil thing than the sin of others; it is as the sin of
the priest, and defiles the Holy Place, even though
unwillingly committed, and thus, even more imperatively
than other sin, demands the exhibition of the
atoning blood of the Lamb of God, not now in the
Holy Place, but more than that, in the true Holiest of
all, where our High Priest is now entered. And thus,
in every possible way, with this elaborate ceremonial
of sprinkling of blood does the sin-offering emphasise
to our own consciences, no less than for ancient Israel,
the solemn fact affirmed in the Epistle to the Hebrews
(ix. 22), "Without shedding of blood there is no remission
of sin."</p>

<p>Because of this, we do well to meditate much and
deeply on this symbolism of the sin-offering, which,
more than any other in the law, has to do with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
propitiation of our Lord for sin. Especially does this
use of the blood, in which the significance of the sin-offering
reached its supreme expression, claim our most
reverent attention. For the thought is inseparable
from the ritual, that the blood of the slain victim must
be presented, not before the priest, or before the offerer,
but before Jehovah. Can any one mistake the evident
significance of this? Does it not luminously hold forth
the thought that atonement by sacrifice has to do, not
only with man, but with God?</p>

<p>There is cause enough in our day for insisting on
this. Many are teaching that the need for the shedding
of blood for the remission of sin, lies only in the nature
of man; that, so far as concerns God, sin might as well
have been pardoned without it; that it is only because
man is so hard and rebellious, so stubbornly distrusts
the Divine love, that the death of the Holy Victim of
Calvary became a necessity. Nothing less than such
a stupendous exhibition of the love of God could
suffice to disarm his enmity to God and win him back
to loving trust. Hence the need of the atonement.
That all this is true, no one will deny; but it is only
half the truth, and the less momentous half,&mdash;which
indeed is hinted in no offering, and in the sin-offering
least of all. Such a conception of the matter as completely
fails to account for this part of the symbolic
ritual of the bloody sacrifices, as it fails to agree with
other teachings of the Scriptures. If the only need
for atonement in order to pardon is in the nature of
the sinner, then why this constant insistence that the
blood of the sacrifice should always be solemnly presented,
not before the sinner, but before Jehovah? We
see in this fact most unmistakably set forth, the very
solemn truth that expiation by blood as a condition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
forgiveness of sin is necessary, not merely because man
is what he is, but most of all because God is what He
is. Let us then not forget that the presentation unto
God of an expiation for sin, accomplished by the death
of an appointed substitutionary victim, was in Israel
made an indispensable condition of the pardon of sin.
Is this, as many urge, against the love of God? By
no means! Least of all will it so appear, when we
remember who appointed the great Sacrifice, and, above
all, who came to fulfil this type. God does not love us
because atonement has been made, but atonement has
been made because the Father loved us, and sent His
Son to be the propitiation for our sins.</p>

<p>God is none the less just, that He is love; and none
the less holy, that He is merciful; and in His nature,
as the Most Just and Holy One, lies this necessity of
the shedding of blood in order to the forgiveness of sin,
which is impressively symbolised in the unvarying
ordinance of the Levitical law, that as a condition of
the remission of sin, the blood of the sacrifice must be
presented, not before the sinner, but before Jehovah.
To this generation of ours, with its so exalted notions
of the greatness and dignity of man, and its correspondingly
low conceptions of the ineffable greatness
and majesty of the Most Holy God, this altar truth
may be most distasteful, so greatly does it magnify
the evil of sin; but just in that degree is it necessary
to the humiliation of man's proud self-complacency,
that, whether pleasing or not, this truth be faithfully
held forth.</p>

<p>Very instructive and helpful to our faith are the
allusions to this sprinkling of blood in the New
Testament. Thus, in the Epistle to the Hebrews
(xii. 24), believers are reminded that they are come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
"unto the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better than
that of Abel." The meaning is plain. For we are told
(Gen. iv. 10), that the blood of Abel cried out against
Cain from the ground; and that its cry for vengeance
was prevailing; for God came down, arraigned the
murderer, and visited him with instant judgment. But
in these words we are told that the sprinkled blood
of the holy Victim of Calvary, sprinkled on the heavenly
altar, also has a voice, and a voice which "speaketh
better than that of Abel;" better, in that it speaks, not
for vengeance, but for pardoning mercy; better, in that
it procures the remission even of a penitent murderer's
guilt; so that, "being now justified through His blood"
we may all "be saved from wrath through Him"
(Rom. v. 9). And, if we are truly Christ's, it is our
blessed comfort to remember also that we are said
(1 Peter i. 2) to have been chosen of God unto the
sprinkling of this precious blood of Jesus Christ; words
which remind us, not only that the blood of a Lamb
"without blemish and without spot" has been presented
unto God for us, but also that the reason for
this distinguishing mercy is found, not in us, but in the
free love of God, who chose us in Christ Jesus to this
grace.</p>

<p>And as in the burnt-offering, so in the sin-offering,
the blood was to be sprinkled by the priest. The
teaching is the same in both cases. To present Christ
before God, laying the hand of faith upon His head as
our sin-offering, this is all we can do or are required to
do. With the sprinkling of the blood we have nothing to
do. In other words, the effective presentation of the
blood before God is not to be secured by some act of
our own; it is not something to be procured through
some subjective experience, other or in addition to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
faith which brings the Victim. As in the type, so in
the Antitype, the sprinkling of the atoning blood&mdash;that
is, its application God-ward as a propitiation&mdash;is the
work of our heavenly Priest. And our part in regard
to it is simply and only this, that we entrust this work
to Him. He will not disappoint us; He is appointed
of God to this end, and He will see that it is done.</p>

<p>In a sacrifice in which the sprinkling of the blood
occupies such a central and essential place in the
symbolism, one would anticipate that this ceremony
would never be dispensed with. Very strange it thus
appears, at first sight, to find that to this law an exception
was made. For it was ordained (ver. 11) that a
man so poor that "his means suffice not" to bring even
two doves or young pigeons, might bring, as a substitute,
an offering of fine flour. From this, some have hastened
to infer that the shedding of the blood, and therewith
the idea of substituted life, was not essential to the
idea of reconciliation with God; but with little reason.
Most illogical and unreasonable it is to determine a
principle, not from the general rule, but from an exception;
especially when, as in this case, for the exception
a reason can be shown, which is not inconsistent with
the rule. For had no such exceptional offering been
permitted in the case of the extremely poor man, it
would have followed that there would have remained
a class of persons in Israel whom God had excluded
from the provision of the sin-offering, which He had
made the inseparable condition of forgiveness. But
two truths were to be set forth in the ritual; the one,
atonement by means of a life surrendered in expiation
of guilt; the other,&mdash;as in a similar way in the
burnt-offering,&mdash;the sufficiency of God's gracious provision
for even the neediest of sinners. Evidently, here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
was a case in which something must be sacrificed in the
symbolism. One of these truths may be perfectly set
forth; both cannot be, with equal perfectness; a choice
must therefore be made, and is made in this exceptional
regulation, so as to hold up clearly, even though at the
expense of some distinctness in the other thought of
expiation, the unlimited sufficiency of God's provision of
forgiving grace.</p>

<p>And yet the prescriptions in this form of the offering
were such as to prevent any one from confounding it
with the meal-offering, which typified consecrated and
accepted service. The oil and the frankincense which
belonged to the latter, are to be left out (ver. 11);
incense, which typifies accepted prayer,&mdash;thus reminding
us of the unanswered prayer of the Holy Victim when
He cried upon the cross, "My God! My God! why hast
Thou forsaken Me?" and oil, which typifies the Holy
Ghost,&mdash;reminding us, again, how from the soul of the
Son of God was mysteriously withdrawn in that same
hour all the conscious presence and comfort of the Holy
Spirit, which withdrawment alone could have wrung from
His lips that unanswered prayer. And, again, whereas
the meal for the meal-offering had no limit fixed as to
quantity, in this case the amount is prescribed&mdash;"the
tenth part of an ephah" (ver. 11); an amount which,
from the story of the manna, appears to have represented
the sustenance of one full day. Thus it was
ordained that if, in the nature of the case, this sin-offering
could not set forth the sacrifice of life by
means of the shedding of blood, it should at least point
in the same direction, by requiring that, so to speak, the
support of life for one day shall be given up, as forfeited
by sin.</p>

<p>All the other parts of the ceremonial are in this ordinance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
made to take a secondary place, or are omitted altogether.
Not all of the offering is burnt upon the altar,
but only a part; that part, however, the fat, the choicest;
for the same reason as in the peace-offering. There is,
indeed, a peculiar variation in the case of the offering of
the two young pigeons, in that, of the one, the blood
only was used in the sacrifice, while the other was
wholly burnt like a burnt-offering. But for this variation
the reason is evident enough in the nature of the
victims. For in the case of a small creature like a
bird, the fat would be so insignificant in quantity, and so
difficult to separate with thoroughness from the flesh,
that the ordinance must needs be varied, and a second
bird be taken for the burning, as a substitute for the
separated fat of larger animals. The symbolism is not
essentially affected by the variation. What the burning
of the fat means in other offerings, that also means the
burning of the second bird in this case.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Eating and the Burning of the Sin-Offering
without the Camp.</span></p>

<p class="center">iv. 8-12, 19-21, 26, 31; v. 10, 12.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And all the fat of the bullock of the sin offering he shall take off
from it; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon
the inwards, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them,
which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys,
shall he take away, as it is taken off from the ox of the sacrifice of peace
offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of burnt offering.
And the skin of the bullock, and all its flesh, with its head, and
with its legs, and its inwards, and its dung, even the whole bullock
shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place, where the
ashes are poured out, and burn it on wood with fire: where the ashes
are poured out shall it be burnt.... And all the fat thereof shall he
take off from it, and burn it upon the altar. Thus shall he do with the
bullock; as he did with the bullock of the sin offering, so shall he do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
with this: and the priest shall make atonement for them, and they
shall be forgiven. And he shall carry forth the bullock without the
camp, and burn it as he burned the first bullock: it is the sin offering
for the assembly.... And all the fat thereof shall he burn upon the
altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall
make atonement for him as concerning his sin, and he shall be forgiven....
And all the fat thereof shall he take away, as the fat is
taken away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest
shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour unto the Lord; and the
priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be forgiven....
And he shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according to the
ordinance: and the priest shall make atonement for him as concerning
his sin which he hath sinned, and he shall be forgiven.... And he
shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it as
the memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar, upon the offerings of
the Lord made by fire: it is a sin offering."</p></blockquote>

<p>In the ritual of the sin-offering, sacrificial meal, such
as that of the peace-offering, wherein the offerer and
his house, with the priest and the Levite, partook
together of the flesh of the sacrificed victim, there was
none. The eating of the flesh of the sin-offerings by
the priests, prescribed in chap. vi. 26, had, primarily, a
different intention and meaning. As set forth elsewhere
(vii. 35), it was "the anointing portion of Aaron and his
sons;" an ordinance expounded by the Apostle Paul to
this effect, that (1 Cor. ix. 13) they which wait upon the
altar should "have their portion with the altar." Yet
not of all the sin-offerings might the priest thus partake.
For when he was himself the one for whom the offering
was made, whether as an individual, or as included
in the congregation, then it is plain that he for the
time stood in the same position before God as the
private individual who had sinned. It was a universal
principle of the law that because of the peculiarly near
and solemn relation into which the expiatory victim had
been brought to God, it was "most holy," and therefore
he for whose sin it is offered could not eat of its flesh.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Hence the general law is laid down (vi. 30): "No sin
offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the
tent of meeting to make atonement in the holy place,
shall be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire."</p>

<p>And yet, although, because the priests could not eat
of the flesh, it must be burnt, it could not be burnt
upon the altar; not, as some have fancied, because it
was regarded as unclean, which is directly contradicted
by the statement that it is "most holy," but because so
to dispose of it would have been to confound the sin-offering
with the burnt-offering, which had, as we have
seen, a specific symbolic meaning, quite distinct from
that of the sin-offering. It must be so disposed of that
nothing shall divert the mind of the worshipper from
the fact that, not sacrifice as representing full consecration,
as in the burnt-offering, but sacrifice as representing
expiation, is set forth in this offering. Hence it
was ordained that the flesh of these sin-offerings for
the anointed priest, or for the congregation, which
included him, should be "burnt on wood with fire
without the camp" (iv. 11, 12, 21). And the more
carefully to guard against the possibility of confounding
this burning of the flesh of the sin-offering with the
sacrificial burning of the victims on the altar, the
Hebrew uses here and in all places where this burning
is referred to, a verb wholly distinct from that which
is used of the burnings on the altar, and which, unlike
that, is used of any ordinary burning of anything for
any purpose.</p>

<p>But this burning of the victim without the camp
was not therefore empty of all typical significance.
The writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews calls our
attention to the fact that in this part of the appointed
ritual there was also that which prefigured Christ and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the circumstances of His death. For we read (Heb.
xiii. 10-12), after an exhortation to Christians to have
done with the ritual observances of Judaism regarding
meats:&mdash;"We," that is, we Christian believers, "have
an altar,"&mdash;the cross upon which Jesus suffered,&mdash;"whereof
they have no right to eat which serve the
tabernacle;" <em>i.e.</em>, they who adhere to the now effete
Jewish tabernacle service, the unbelieving Israelites,
derive no benefit from this sacrifice of ours. "For the
bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the
Holy Place by the high priest as an offering for sin, are
burned without the camp;" the priesthood are debarred
from eating them, according to the law we have before
us. And then attention is called to the fact that in this
respect Jesus fulfilled this part of the type of the sin-offering,
thus: "Wherefore Jesus also, that He might
sanctify the people with His own blood, suffered without
the camp." That is, as Alford interprets (Comm.
sub. loc.), in the circumstance that Jesus suffered
without the gate, is seen a visible adumbration of the
fact that He suffered outside the camp of legal Judaism,
and thus, in that He suffered for the sin of the whole
congregation of Israel, fulfilled the type of this sin-offering
in this particular. Thus a prophecy is discovered
here which perhaps we had not else discerned,
concerning the manner of the death of the antitypical
victim. He should suffer as a victim for the sin of the
whole congregation, the priestly people, who should
for that reason be debarred, in fulfilment of the type,
from that benefit of His death which had else been their
privilege. And herein was accomplished to the uttermost
that surrender of His whole being to God, in that,
in carrying out that full consecration, "He, bearing
His cross went forth," not merely outside the gate of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Jerusalem,&mdash;in itself a trivial circumstance,&mdash;but, as
this fitly symbolised, outside the congregation of Israel,
to suffer. In other words, His consecration of Himself
to God in self-sacrifice found its supreme expression in
this, that He voluntarily submitted to be cast out from
Israel, despised and rejected of men, even of the Israel
of God.</p>

<p>And so this burning of the flesh of the sin-offering
of the highest grade in two places, the fat upon the
altar, in the court of the congregation, and the rest of
the victim outside the camp, set forth prophetically the
full self-surrender of the Son to the Father, as the sin-offering,
in a double aspect: in the former, emphasising
simply, as in the peace-offering, His surrender of all
that was highest and best in Him, as Son of God and
Son of man, unto the Father as a Sin-offering; in the
latter, foreshowing that He should also, in a special
manner, be a sacrifice for the sin of the congregation
of Israel, and that His consecration should receive its
fullest exhibition and most complete expression in that
He should die outside the camp of legal Judaism, as an
outcast from the congregation of Israel.</p>

<p>Accordingly we find that this part of the type of the
sin-offering was formally accomplished when the high
priest, upon Christ's confession before the Sanhedrim
of His Sonship to God, declared Him to be guilty of
blasphemy; an offence for which it had been ordered
by the Lord (Lev. xxiv. 14) that the guilty person should
be taken "without the camp" to suffer for his sin.</p>

<p>In the light of these marvellous correspondences
between the typical sin-offering and the self-offering of
the Son of God, what a profound meaning more and
more appears in those words of Christ concerning
Moses: "He wrote of Me."</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Sanctity of the Sin-Offering.</span></p>

<p class="center">vi. 24-30.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto Aaron and
to his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin offering: in the place
where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before
the Lord: it is most holy. The priest that offereth it for sin shall
eat it: in a holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tent of
meeting. Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy:
and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment,
thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in a holy place. But
the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken: and if it be
sodden in a brasen vessel, it shall be scoured, and rinsed in water.
Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it is most holy. And
no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the tent of
meeting to make atonement in the holy place, shall be eaten: it shall
be burnt with fire."</p></blockquote>

<p>In chap. vi. 24-30 we have a section which is
supplemental to the law of the sin-offering, in which,
with some repetition of the laws previously given, are
added certain special regulations, in fuller exposition of
the peculiar sanctity attaching to this offering. As in
the case of other offerings called "most holy," it is
ordered that only the males among the priests shall
eat of it; among whom, the officiating priest takes the
precedence. Further, it is declared that everything that
touches the offering shall be regarded as "holy," that
is, as invested with the sanctity attaching to every
person or thing specially devoted to the Lord.</p>

<p>Then by way of application of this principle to two
of the most common cases in which it could apply, it
is ordered, first (ver. 27), with regard to any garment
which should be sprinkled with the blood, "thou shalt
wash that whereon it was sprinkled in a holy place;"
that so by no chance should the least of the blood
which had been shed for the remission of sin, come into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
contact with anything unclean and unholy. And then,
again, inasmuch as the flesh which should be eaten by
the priest must needs be cooked, and the vessel used
by this contact became holy, it is commanded (ver. 28)
that, if a brazen vessel, "it shall be scoured" and
"then rinsed with water;" that in no case should
a vessel in which might remain the least of the sacrificial
flesh, be used for any profane purpose, and so the
holy flesh be defiled. And because when an (unglazed)
earthen vessel was used, even such scouring and rinsing
could not so cleanse it, but that something of the juices
of the holy flesh should be absorbed into its substance,
therefore, in order to preclude the possibility of its
ever being used for any common purpose it is directed
(ver. 28) that it shall be broken.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>By such regulations as these, it is plain that even
in those days of little light the thoughtful Israelite
would be impressed with the feeling that in the expiation
of sin he came into a peculiarly near and solemn
relation to the holiness of God, even though he might
not be able to formulate his thought more exactly. In
modern times, however, strange to say, these very
regulations with regard to the sin-offering, when it has
been taken as typical of Christ, have been used as an
argument against the New Testament teaching as to
the expiatory nature of His death as a true satisfaction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
to the holy justice of God for the sins of men. For
it is argued, that if Christ was really, in a legal sense,
regarded as a sinner, because standing in the sinner's
place, to receive in His person the wrath of God against
the sinner's sin, it could not have been ordered that
the blood and the flesh of the typical offering should be
thus regarded as of peculiar and pre-eminent holiness.
Rather, we are told, should we, for example, have read
in the ritual, "No one, and, least of all, the priests,
shall eat of it; for it is most unclean." An extraordinary
argument and conclusion! For surely it is
an utter misapprehension both of the so-called "orthodox"
view of the atonement, and of the New Testament
teaching on the subject, to represent it as involving the
suggestion that Christ, when for us "made sin," and
suffering as our substitute, thereby must have been for
the time Himself unclean. Surely, according to the constant
use of the word, in imputation of sin, of any sin,
to any one, there is no conveyance of character; it is
only implied that such person is, for whatsoever reason,
justly or unjustly, treated as if he were guilty of that
sin which is imputed to him. Imputing falsehood to
a man who is truth itself, does not make him a liar,
though it does involve treating him as if he were. Just
so it is in this case.</p>

<p>There is, then, in these regulations which emphasise
the peculiar holiness of the sin-offering, nothing which
is inconsistent with the strictest juridical view of the
great atonement which in type it represented. On
the contrary, one can hardly think of anything which
should more effectively represent the great truth of the
incomparable holiness of the victim of Calvary, than
just this strenuous insistence that the blood and the
flesh of the typical victim should be treated as of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
most peculiar sanctity. If, when we see the victim of
the sin-offering slain and its blood presented before God,
we behold a vivid representation of Christ, the Lamb
of God, "made sin in our behalf;" so when, in these
regulations, we see how the flesh and blood of the offered
victim is treated as of the most pre-eminent sanctity,
we are as impressively reminded how it is written
(2 Cor. v. 21) that it was "Him who knew no sin," that
God "made to be sin on our behalf." Thus does the
type, in order that nothing might be wanting in this law
of the offering, insist in every possible way on the holiness
of the great Victim who became the Antitype; and
most of all in the sin-offering, because in this, where,
not consecration of the person or the works, or the
impartation and fellowship of the life of Christ, but
expiation, was the central idea of the sacrifice, there
was a special need for emphasising, in an exceptional
way, this thought; that the Victim who bore our sins,
although visibly laden with the curse of God, was none
the less all the time Himself "most holy;" so that in
that unfathomable mystery of Calvary, never was He
more truly and really the well-beloved Son of the Father
than when He cried out in the extremity of His anguish
as "made sin for us," "My God, My God, why hast
Thou forsaken Me?"</p>

<p>How wonderfully adapted in all its details was this
law of the sin-offering, not only for the education of
Israel, but, if we will meditate upon these things, also
for our own! How the truths which underlie this law
should humble us, even in proportion as they exalt to
the uttermost the ineffable majesty of the holiness of
God! And, if we will but yield to their teachings,
how mightily should they constrain us, in grateful
recognition of the love of the Holy One who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
"made sin in our behalf," and of the love of the
Father who sent Him for this end, to accept Him as
our Sin-offering, set forth in the consummation of the
ages, "to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself." No
more are offered the sin-offerings of the law of Moses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="indent1">Takes all our sins away;</div>
<div class="line">A sacrifice of nobler name,</div>
<div class="indent1">And richer blood, than they."</div>
</div></div>

<p>If, then, the law of the Levitical sin-offering abides
in force no longer, this is not because God has changed,
or because the truths which it set forth concerning
sin, and expiation, and pardon, are obsolete, but only
because the great Sin-offering which the ancient sacrifice
typified, has now appeared. God hath "taken away
the first, that He may establish the second" (Heb. x.
9). We have thus to do with the same God as the
Israelite. Now, as then, He takes account of all our
sins, even of sins committed "unwittingly;" He reckons
guilt with the same absolute impartiality and justice as
then; He pardons sin, as then, only when the sinner
who seeks pardon, presents a sin-offering. But He has
now Himself provided the Lamb for this offering, and
now in infinite love invites us all, without distinction,
with whatsoever sins we may be burdened, to make
free use of the all-sufficient and most efficient blood of
His well-beloved Son. Shall we risk neglecting this
Divine provision, and undertake to deal with God by-and-bye,
in the great day of judgment, on our own
merits, without a sacrifice for sin? God forbid! Rather
let us go on to say in the words of that old hymn:&mdash;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<h3><em>THE GUILT-OFFERING.</em></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lev.</span> v. 14; vi. 7; vii. 1-7.</p>


<p>As in the English version, so also in the Hebrew,
the special class of sins for which the guilt-offering<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
is prescribed, is denoted by a distinct and
specific word. That word, like the English "trespass,"
its equivalent, always has reference to an invasion of
the rights of others, especially in respect of property or
service. It is used, for instance, of the sin of Achan
(Josh. vii. 1), who had appropriated spoil from Jericho,
which God had commanded to be set apart for Himself.
Thus, also, the neglect of God's service, and especially
the worship of idols, is often described by this same
word, as in 2 Chron. xxviii. 22, xxix. 6, and many
other places. The reason is evident; for idolatry involved
a withholding from God of those tithes and
other offerings which He claimed from Israel, and thus
became, as it were, an invasion of the Divine rights of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
property. The same word is even applied to the sin of
adultery (Numb. v. 12, 27), apparently from the same
point of view, inasmuch as the woman is regarded as
belonging to her husband, who has therefore in her
certain sacred rights, of which adultery is an invasion.
Thus, while every "trespass" is a sin, yet every sin is
not a "trespass." There are, evidently, many sins of
which this is not a characteristic feature. But the sins
for which the guilt-offering is prescribed are in every
case sins which <em>may</em>, at least, be specially regarded under
this particular point of view, to wit, as trespasses on
the rights of God or man in respect of ownership; and
this gives us the fundamental thought which distinguishes
the guilt-offering from all others, namely, that
for any invasion of the rights of another in regard to
property, not only must expiation be made, in that it
is a sin, but also satisfaction, and, so far as possible,
plenary reparation of the wrong, in that the sin is also
trespass.</p>

<p>From this it is evident that, as contrasted with the
burnt-offering, which pre-eminently symbolised full consecration
of the person, and the peace-offering, which
symbolised fellowship with God, as based upon reconciliation
by sacrifice, the guilt-offering takes its place,
in a general sense, with the sin-offering, as, like that,
specially designed to effect the reinstatement of an
offender in covenant relation with God. Thus, like the
latter, and unlike the former offerings, it was only prescribed
with reference to specific instances of failure
to fulfil some particular obligation toward God or man.
So also, as the express condition of an acceptable
offering, the formal confession of such sin was particularly
enjoined. And, finally, unlike the burnt-offering,
which was wholly consumed upon the altar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
or the peace-offering, of the flesh of which, with certain
reservations, the worshipper himself partook, in the
case of the guilt-offering, as in the sin-offering, the fat
parts only were burnt on the altar, and the remainder
of the victim fell to the priests, to be eaten by them
alone in a holy place, as a thing "most holy." The
law is given in the following words (vii. 3-7): "He
shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the fat tail, and the
fat that covereth the inwards, and the two kidneys, and
the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the
caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take
away: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar
for an offering made by fire unto the Lord: it is a
guilt offering. Every male among the priests shall eat
thereof: it shall be eaten in a holy place: it is most
holy. As is the sin offering, so is the guilt offering:
there is one law for them: the priest that maketh
atonement therewith, he shall have it."</p>

<p>But while, in a general way, the guilt-offering was
evidently intended, like the sin-offering, to signify the
removal of sin from the conscience through sacrifice, and
thus may be regarded as a variety of the sin-offering,
yet the ritual presents some striking variations from
that of the latter. These are all explicable from this
consideration, that whereas the sin-offering represented
the idea of atonement by sacrifice, regarded as an
<em>expiation</em> of guilt, the guilt-offering represented atonement
under the aspect of a <em>satisfaction</em> and <em>reparation</em>
for the wrong committed. Hence, because the idea of
expiation here fell somewhat into the background, in
order to give the greater prominence to that of reparation
and satisfaction, the application of the blood is
only made, as in the burnt-offering and the peace-offering,
by sprinkling "on the altar (of burnt-offering)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
round about" (vii. 1). Hence, again, we find that the
guilt-offering always had reference to the sin of the
individual, and never to the congregation; because it
was scarcely possible that every individual in the
whole congregation should be guilty in such instances
as those for which the guilt-offering is prescribed.</p>

<p>Again, we have another contrast in the restriction
imposed upon the choice of the victim for the sacrifice.
In the sin-offering, as we have seen, it was ordained that
the offering should be varied according to the theocratic
rank of the offender, to emphasise thereby to the
conscience gradations of guilt, as thus determined;
also, it was permitted that the offering might be varied
in value according to the ability of the offerer, in order
that it might thus be signified in symbol that it was
the gracious will of God that nothing in the personal
condition of the sinner should exclude any one from
the merciful provision of the expiatory sacrifice. But
it was no less important that another aspect of the
matter should be held forth, namely, that God is no
respecter of persons; and that, whatever be the condition
of the offender, the obligation to plenary satisfaction
and reparation for trespass committed, cannot
be modified in any way by the circumstances of the
offender. The man who, for example, has defrauded
his neighbour, whether of a small sum or of a large
estate, abides his debtor before God, under all conceivable
conditions, until restitution is made. The
obligation of full payment rests upon every debtor, be
he poor or rich, until the last farthing is discharged.
Hence, the sacrificial victim of the guilt-offering is the
same, whether for the poor man or the rich man, "a
ram of the flock."</p>

<p>It was "a ram of the flock," because, as contrasted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
with the ewe or the lamb, or the dove and the pigeon,
it was a valuable offering. And yet it is not a bullock,
the most valuable offering known to the law, because
that might be hopelessly out of the reach of many a
poor man. The idea of value must be represented, and
yet not so represented as to exclude a large part of the
people from the provisions of the guilt-offering. The
ram must be "without blemish," that naught may
detract from its value, as a symbol of full satisfaction
for the wrong done.</p>

<p>But most distinctive of all the requisitions touching
the victim is this, that, unlike all other victims for
other offerings, the ram of the guilt-offering must in
each case be definitely appraised by the priest. The
phrase is (v. 15), that it must be "according to thy
estimation in silver by shekels, after the shekel of the
sanctuary." This expression evidently requires, first,
that the offerer's own estimate of the value of the
victim shall not be taken, but that of the priest, as
representing God in this transaction; and, secondly,
that its value shall in no case fall below a certain
standard; for the plural expression, "by shekels,"
implies that the value of the ram shall not be less than
two shekels. And the shekel must be of full weight;
the standard of valuation must be God's, and not man's,
"the shekel of the sanctuary."</p>

<p>Still more to emphasise the distinctive thought of
this sacrifice, that full satisfaction and reparation for
all offences is with God the universal and unalterable
condition of forgiveness, it was further ordered that in
all cases where the trespass was of such a character as
made this possible, that which had been unjustly taken
or kept back, whether from God or man, should be
restored "in full;" and not only this, but inasmuch as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
by this misappropriation of what was not his own, the
offender had for the time deprived another of the use
and enjoyment of that which belonged to him, he must
add to that of which he had defrauded him "the fifth
part more," a double tithe. Thus the guilty person was
not allowed to have gained even any temporary advantage
from the use for a while of that which he now
restored; for "the fifth part more" would presumably
quite overbalance all conceivable advantage or enjoyment
which he might have had from his fraud. How
admirable in all this the exact justice of God! How
perfectly adapted was the guilt-offering, in all these
particulars, to educate the conscience, and to preclude
any possible wrong inferences from the allowance which
was made, for other reasons, for the poor man, in the
expiatory offerings for sin!</p>

<p>The arrangement of the law of the guilt-offering is
very simple. It is divided into two sections, the first
of which (v. 14-19) deals with cases of trespass "in
the holy things of the Lord," things which, by the
law or by an act of consecration, were regarded as
belonging in a special sense to Jehovah; the second
section, on the other hand (vi. 1-7), deals with cases
of trespass on the property rights of man.</p>

<p>The first of these, again, consists of two parts.
Verses 14-16 give the law of the guilt-offering as
applied to cases in which a man, through inadvertence
or unwittingly, trespasses in the holy things of the Lord,
but in such manner that the nature and extent of the
trespass can afterward be definitely known and valued;
verses 17-19 deal with cases where there has been
trespass such as to burden the conscience, and yet
such as, for whatsoever reason, cannot be precisely
measured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>By "the holy things of the Lord" are intended such
things as, either by universal ordinance or by voluntary
consecration, were regarded as belonging to Jehovah,
and in a special sense His property. Thus, under this
head would come the case of the man who, for instance,
should unwittingly eat the flesh of the firstling of his
cattle, or the flesh of the sin-offering, or the shew-bread;
or should use his tithe, or any part of it, for
himself. Even though he did this unwittingly, yet it
none the less disturbed the man's relation to God; and
therefore, when known, in order to his reinstatement
in fellowship with God, it was necessary that he should
make full restitution with a fifth part added, and,
besides this, sacrifice a ram, duly appraised, as a guilt-offering.
In that the sacrifice was prescribed over and
above the restitution, the worshipper was reminded
that, in view of the infinite majesty and holiness of
God, it lies not in the power of any creature to nullify
the wrong God-ward, even by fullest restitution. For
trespass is not only trespass, but is also sin; an offence
not only against the rights of Jehovah as Owner, but
also an affront to Him as Supreme King and Lawgiver.</p>

<p>And yet, because the worshipper must not be allowed
to lose sight of the fact that sin is of the nature of a
debt, a victim was ordered which should especially bring
to mind this aspect of the matter. For not only among
the Hebrews, but among the Arabs, the Romans and
other ancient peoples, sheep, and especially rams, were
very commonly used as a medium of payment in case
of debt, and especially in paying tribute.</p>

<p>Thus we read (2 Kings iii. 4), that Mesha, king of
Moab, rendered unto the king of Israel "an hundred
thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with
the wool," in payment of tribute; and, at a later day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Isaiah (xvi. 1, R.V.) delivers to Moab the mandate of
Jehovah: "Send ye the lambs for the ruler of the land
... unto the mount of the daughter of Zion."</p>

<p>And so the ram having been brought and presented
by the guilty person, with confession of his fault, it was
slain by the priest, like the sin-offering. The blood,
however, was not applied to the horns of the altar of
burnt-offering, still less brought into the Holy Place, as
in the case of the sin-offering; but (vii. 2) was to be
sprinkled "upon the altar round about," as in the burnt-offering.
The reason of this difference in the application
of the blood, as above remarked, lies in this, that, as in
the burnt-offering, the idea of sacrifice as symbolising
expiation takes a place secondary and subordinate to
another thought; in this case, the conception of sacrifice
as representing satisfaction for trespass.</p>

<p>The next section (vv. 17-19) does not expressly
mention sins of trespass; for which reason some have
thought that it was essentially a repetition of the law
of the sin-offering. But that it is not to be so regarded
is plain from the fact that the victim is still the same as
for the guilt-offering, and from the explicit statement
(ver. 19) that this "is a guilt-offering." The inference
is natural that the prescription still has reference to
"trespass in the holy things of the Lord;" and the
class of cases intended is probably indicated by the
phrase, "though he knew it not." In the former
section, the law provided for cases in which though the
trespass had been done unwittingly, yet the offender
afterward came to know of the trespass in its precise
extent, so as to give an exact basis for the restitution
ordered in such cases. But it is quite supposable that
there might be cases in which, although the offender
was aware that there had been a probable trespass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
such as to burden his conscience, he yet knew not just
how much it was. The ordinance is only in so far
modified as such a case would make necessary; where
there was no exact knowledge of the amount of trespass,
obviously there the law of restitution with the added
fifth could not be applied. Yet, none the less, the man
is guilty; he "bears his iniquity," that is, he is liable
to the penalty of his fault; and in order to the re-establishment
of his covenant relation with God, the ram
must be offered as a guilt-offering.</p>

<p>It is suggestive to observe the emphasis which is laid
upon the necessity of the guilt-offering, even in such
cases. Three times, reference is explicitly made to this
fact of ignorance, as not affecting the requirement of the
guilt-offering: (ver. 17) "Though he knew it not, yet
is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity;" and again
(ver. 18), with special explicitness, "The priest shall
make atonement for him concerning the thing wherein
he erred unwittingly and knew it not;" and yet
again (ver. 19), "It is a guilt-offering: he is certainly
guilty before the Lord." The repetition is an urgent
reminder that in this case, as in all others, we are never
to forget that however our ignorance of a trespass at
the time, or even lack of definite knowledge regarding
its nature and extent, may affect the degree of our guilt,
it cannot affect the fact of our guilt, and the consequent
necessity for satisfaction in order to acceptance with
God.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The second section of the law of the guilt-offering
(vi. 1-7) deals with trespasses against man, as also,
like trespasses against Jehovah, requiring, in order to
forgiveness from God, full restitution with the added
fifth, and the offering of the ram as a guilt-offering.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Five cases are named (vv. 2, 3,), no doubt as being
common, typical examples of sins of this character.</p>

<p>The first case is trespass upon a neighbour's rights
in "a matter of deposit;" where a man has entrusted
something to another to keep, and he has either sold it
or unlawfully used it as if it were his own. The second
case takes in all fraud in a "bargain," as when, for
example, a man sells goods, or a piece of land, representing
them to be better than they really are, or
asking a price larger than he knows an article to be
really worth. The third instance is called "robbery;"
by which we are to understand any act or process,
even though it should be under colour of legal forms,
by means of which a man may manage unjustly to get
possession of the property of his neighbour, without
giving him due equivalent therefor. The fourth instance
is called "oppression" of his neighbour. The English
word contains the same image as the Hebrew word,
which is used, for instance, of the unnecessary retention
of the wages of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">employé</i> by the employer
(xix. 13); it may be applied to all cases in which a man
takes advantage of another's circumstances to extort
from him any thing or any service to which he has no
right, or to force upon him something which it is to
the poor man's disadvantage to take. The last example
of offences to which the law of the guilt-offering applied,
is the case in which a man finds something and then
denies it to the rightful owner. The reference to false
swearing which follows, as appears from ver. 5, refers not
merely to lying and perjury concerning this last-named
case, but equally to all cases in which a man may lie
or swear falsely to the pecuniary damage of his neighbour.
It is mentioned not merely as aggravating such
sin, but because in swearing touching any matter, a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
appeals to God as witness to the truth of his words; so
that by swearing in these cases he represents God as
a party to his falsehood and injustice.</p>

<p>In all these cases, the prescription is the same as in
analogous offences in the holy things of Jehovah. First
of all, the guilty man must confess the wrong which he
has done (Numb. v. 7), then restitution must be made of
all of which he has defrauded his neighbour, together
with one-fifth additional. But while this may set him
right with man, it has not yet set him right with God.
He must bring his guilt-offering unto Jehovah (vv.
6, 7); "a ram without blemish out of the flock, according
to the priest's estimation, for a guilt offering, unto
the priest: and the priest shall make atonement for
him before the Lord, and he shall be forgiven; concerning
whatsoever he doeth so as to be guilty thereby."</p>

<p>And this completes the law of the guilt-offering. It
was thus prescribed for sins which involve a defrauding
or injuring of another in respect to material things,
whether God or man, whether knowingly or unwittingly.
The law was one and unalterable for all; the condition
of pardon was plenary restitution for the wrong done, and
the offering of a costly sacrifice, appraised as such by
the priest, the earthly representative of God, in the
shekel of the sanctuary, "a ram without blemish out
of the flock."</p>

<p>There are lessons from this ordinance, so plain that,
even in the dim light of those ancient days, the Israelite
might discern and understand them. And they are
lessons which, because man and his ways are the same
as then, and God the same as then, are no less pertinent
to all of us to-day.</p>

<p>Thus we are taught by this law that God claims from
man, and especially from His own people, certain rights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
of property, of which He will not allow Himself to be
defrauded, even through man's forgetfulness or inadvertence.
In a later day Israel was sternly reminded
of this in the burning words of Jehovah by the prophet
Malachi (iii. 8, 9): "Will a man rob God? yet ye
rob me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee?
In tithes and offerings. Ye are cursed with the curse;
for ye rob me, even this whole nation." Nor has God
relaxed His claim in the present dispensation. For the
Apostle Paul charges the Corinthian Christians (2 Cor.
viii. 7), in the name of the Lord, with regard to their
gifts, that as they abounded in other graces, so they
should "abound in this grace also." And this is the
first lesson brought before us in the law of the guilt-offering.
God claims His tithe, His first-fruit, and the
fulfilment of all vows. It was a lesson for that time;
it is no less a lesson for our time.</p>

<p>And the guilt-offering further reminds us that as
God has rights, so man also has rights, and that
Jehovah, as the King and Judge of men, will exact the
satisfaction of those rights, and will pass over no injury
done by man to his neighbour in material things, nor
forgive it unto any man, except upon condition of the
most ample material restitution to the injured party.</p>

<p>Then, yet again, if the sin-offering called especially
for <em>faith</em> in an expiatory sacrifice as the condition of
the Divine forgiveness, the guilt-offering as specifically
called also for <em>repentance</em>, as a condition of pardon,
no less essential. Its unambiguous message to every
Israelite was the same as that of John the Baptist at
a later day (Matt. iii. 8, 9): "Bring forth fruit worthy
of repentance: and think not to say within yourselves,
We have Abraham to our father."</p>

<p>The reminder is as much needed now as in the days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
of Moses. How specific and practical the selection of
the particular instances mentioned as cases for the
application of the inexorable law of the guilt-offering!
Let us note them again, for they are not cases peculiar
to Israel or to the fifteenth century before Christ. "If
any one ... deal falsely with his neighbour in a
matter of deposit;" as, <em>e.g.</em>, in the case of moneys
entrusted to a bank or railway company, or other
corporation; for there is no hint that the law did not
apply except to individuals, or that a man might be
released from these stringent obligations of righteousness
whenever in some such evil business he was associated
with others; the guilt-offering must be forthcoming,
with the amplest restitution, or there is no pardon. Then
false dealing in a "bargain" is named, as involving
the same requirement; as when a man prides himself
on driving "a good bargain," by getting something
unfairly for less than its value, taking advantage of
his neighbour's straits; or by selling something for
more than its value, taking advantage of his neighbour's
ignorance, or his necessity. Then is mentioned "robbery;"
by which word is covered not merely that
which goes by the name in polite circles, but all cases
in which a man takes advantage of his neighbour's
distress or helplessness, perhaps by means of some
technicality of law, to "strip" him, as the Hebrew
word is, of his property of any kind. And next is
specified the man who may "have oppressed his
neighbour," especially a man or woman who serves
him, as the usage of the word suggests; grinding thus
the face of the poor; paying, for instance, less for
labour than the law of righteousness and love demands,
because the poor man must have work or starve with
his house. What sweeping specifications! And all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
such, in all lands and all ages, are solemnly reminded
in the law of the guilt-offering that in these their sharp
practices they have to reckon not with man merely,
but with God; and that it is utterly vain for a man
to hope for the forgiveness of sin from God, offering
or no offering, so long as he has in his pocket his
neighbour's money. For all such, full restoration with
the added fifth, according to the law of the theocratic
kingdom, was the unalterable condition of the Divine
forgiveness; and we shall find that this law of the
theocratic kingdom will also be the law applied in the
adjudications of the great white throne.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in that it was particularly enjoined that
in the estimation of the value of the guilt-offering, not
the shekel of the people, often of light weight, but the
full weight "shekel of the sanctuary" was to be held
the invariable standard; we, who are so apt to ease
things to our consciences by applying to our conduct
the principles of judgment current among men, are
plainly taught that if we will have our trespasses forgiven,
the reparation and restitution which we make
must be measured, not by the standard of men, but by
that of God, which is absolute righteousness.</p>

<p>Yet again, in that in the case of all such trespasses
on the rights of God or man it was ordained that
the offering, unlike other sacrifices intended to teach
other lessons, should be one and the same, whether the
offender were rich or poor; we are taught that the extent
of our moral obligations or the conditions of their equitable
discharge are not determined by a regard to our
present ability to make them good. Debt is debt by
whomsoever owed. If a man have appropriated a hundred
pounds of another man's money, the moral obligation
of that debt cannot be abrogated by a bankrupt law,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
allowing him to compromise at ten shillings in the
pound. The law of man may indeed release him from
liability to prosecution, but no law can discharge such
a man from the unalterable obligation to pay penny for
penny, farthing for farthing. There is no bankrupt law
in the kingdom of God. This, too, is evidently a lesson
quite as much needed by Gentiles and nominal Christians
in the nineteenth century after Christ, as by Hebrews
in the fifteenth century before Christ.</p>

<p>But the spiritual teaching of the guilt-offering is
not yet exhausted. For, like all the other offerings, it
pointed to Christ. He is "the end of the law unto
righteousness" (Rom. x. 4), as regards the guilt-offering,
as in all else. As the burnt-offering prefigured
Christ the heavenly Victim, in one aspect, and the
peace-offering, Christ in another aspect, so the guilt-offering
presents to our adoring contemplation yet
another view of His sacrificial work. While, as our
burnt-offering, He became our <em>righteousness</em> in full self-consecration;
as our peace-offering, our <em>life</em>; as our
sin-offering, the <em>expiation</em> for our sins; so, as our
guilt-offering, He made <em>satisfaction</em> and plenary reparation
in our behalf to the God on whose inalienable
rights in us, by our sins we had trespassed without
measure.</p>

<p>Nor is this an over-refinement of exposition. For in
Isa. liii. 10, where both the Authorised and the Revised
Versions read, "shall make his soul <em>an offering for sin</em>,"
the margin of the latter rightly calls attention to the
fact that in the Hebrew the word here used is the very
same which through all this Levitical law is rendered
"guilt-offering." And so we are expressly told by this
evangelic prophet, that the Holy Servant of Jehovah,
the suffering Messiah, in this His sacrificial work should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
make His soul "a guilt-offering." He became Himself
the complete and exhaustive realisation of all that in
sacrifice which was set forth in the Levitical guilt-offering.</p>

<p>A declaration this is which holds forth both the
sin for which Christ atoned, and the Sacrifice itself,
in a very distinct and peculiar light. In that Christ's
sacrifice was thus a guilt-offering in the sense of the
law, we are taught that, in one aspect, our sins are
regarded by God, and should therefore be regarded by
us, as debts which are due from us to God. This is,
indeed, by no means the only aspect in which sin should
be regarded; it is, for example, rebellion, high treason,
a deadly affront to the Supreme Majesty, which must
be expiated with the blood of the sin-offering. But our
sins are also of the nature of debts. That is, God has
claims on us for service which we have never met;
claims for a portion of our substance which we have
often withheld, or given grudgingly, trespassing thus
in "the holy things of the Lord." Just as the servant
who is set to do his master's work, if, instead, he take
that time to do his own work, is debtor to the full value
of the service of which his master is thus defrauded, so
stands the case between the sinner and God. Just as
with the agent who fails to make due returns to his principal
on the moneys committed to him for investment,
using them instead for himself, so stands the case
between God and the sinner who has used his talents, not
for the Lord, but for himself, or has kept them laid up,
unused, in a napkin. Thus, in the New Testament, as
the correlate of this representation of Christ as a guilt-offering,
we find sin again and again set forth as a debt
which is owed from man to God. So, in the Lord's
prayer we are taught to pray, "Forgive us our debts;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
so, twice the Lord Himself in His parables (Matt.
xviii. 23-35; Luke vii. 41, 42) set forth the relation of
the sinner to God as that of the debtor to the creditor;
and concerning those on whom the tower of Siloam fell,
asks (Luke xiii. 4), "Think ye that they were sinners
(<em>Greek</em> 'debtors,') above all that dwelt in Jerusalem?"
Indeed so imbedded is this thought in the conscience of
man that it has been crystallised in our word "ought,"
which is but the old preterite of "owe;" as in Tyndale's
New Testament, where we read (Luke vii. 41), "there
was a certain lender, which ought him five hundred
pence." What a startling conception is this, which
forms the background to the great "guilt-offering"!
Man a debtor to God! a debtor for service each day
due, but no day ever fully and perfectly rendered! in
gratitude for gifts, too often quite forgotten, oftener
only paid in scanty part! We are often burdened and
troubled greatly about our debts to men; shall we not
be concerned about the enormous and ever accumulating
debt to God! Or is He an easy creditor, who is
indifferent whether these debts of ours be met or not?
So think multitudes; but this is not the representation
of Scripture, either in the Old or the New Testament.
For in the law it was required, that if a man, guilty of
any of these offences for the forgiveness of which the
guilt-offering was prescribed, failed to confess and
bring the offering, and make the restitution with the
added fifth, as commanded by the law, he should be
brought before the judges, and the full penalty of law
exacted, on the principle of "an eye for an eye, a tooth
for a tooth!" And in the New Testament, one of
those solemn parables of the two debtors closes with
the awful words concerning one of them who was
"delivered to the tormentors," that he should not come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
out of prison till he had "paid the uttermost farthing."
Not a hint is there in Holy Scripture, of forgiveness of
our debts to God, except upon the one condition of full
restitution made to Him to whom the debt is due, and
therewith the sacrificial blood of a guilt-offering. But
Christ is our Guilt-Offering. He is our Guilt-Offering,
in that He Himself did that, really and fully, with respect
to all our debts as sinful men to God, which the guilt-offering
of Leviticus symbolised, but accomplished not.
His soul He made a guilt-offering for our trespasses!
Isaiah's words imply that He should make full restitution
for all that of which we, as sinners, defraud God.
He did this by that perfect and incomparable service
of lowly obedience such as we should render, but have
never rendered; in which He has made full satisfaction
to God for all our innumerable debts. He has made
such satisfaction, not by a convenient legal fiction, or in
a rhetorical figure, or as judged by any human standard.
Even as the ram of the guilt-offering was appraised
according to "the shekel of the sanctuary," so upon
our Lord, at the beginning of that life of sacrificial
service, was solemnly passed the Divine verdict that
with this antitypical Victim of the Guilt-Offering, God
Himself was "well pleased" (Matt. iii. 17).</p>

<p>Not only so. For we cannot forget that according
to the law, not only the full restitution must be made,
but the fifth must be added thereto. So with our
Lord. For who will not confess that Christ not only
did all that we should have done, but, in the ineffable
depth of His self-humiliation and obedience unto death,
even the death of the cross, paid therewith the added
fifth of the law. Said a Jewish Rabbi to the writer, "I
have never been able to finish reading in the Gospel
the story of the Jesus of Nazareth; for it too soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
brings the tears to my eyes!" So affecting even to
Jewish unbelief was this unparalleled spectacle, the
adorable Son of God making Himself a guilt-offering,
and paying, in the incomparable perfection of His holy
obedience, the added fifth in our behalf! Thus has
Christ "magnified this law" of the guilt-offering, and
"made it honourable," even as He did all law (Isa.
xlii. 21).</p>

<p>And, as is intimated, by the formal valuation of the
sacrificial ram, in the type, even the death of Christ as
the guilt-offering, in one aspect is to be regarded as the
consummating act of service in the payment of debts
Godward. Just as the sin-offering represented His
death in its passive aspect, as meeting the demands of
justice against the sinner as a rebel under sentence of
death, by dying in his stead, so, on the other hand,
the guilt-offering represents that same sacrificial death,
rather in another aspect, no less clearly set forth in the
New Testament; namely, the supreme act of obedience to
the will of God, whereby He discharged "to the uttermost
farthing," even with the added fifth of the law, all
the transcendent debt of service due from man to God.</p>

<p>This representation of Christ's work has in all ages
been an offence, "the offence of the cross." All the
more need we to insist upon it, and never to forget, or
let others forget, that Christ is expressly declared in
the Word of God to have been "a guilt-offering," in
the Levitical sense of that term; that, therefore, to
speak of His death as effecting our salvation merely
through its moral influence, is to contradict and nullify
the Word of God. Well may we set this word in
Isa. liii. 10, concerning the Servant of Jehovah, against
all modern Unitarian theology, and against all Socinianising
teaching; all that would maintain any view of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Christ's death which excludes or ignores the divinely
revealed fact that it was in its essential nature a guilt-offering;
and, because a guilt-offering, therefore of the
nature of the payment of a debt in behalf of those for
whom He suffered.</p>

<p>Most blessed truth this, for all who can receive it!
Christ, the Son of God, our Guilt-Offering! Like the
poor Israelite, who had defrauded God of that which
was His due, so must we do; coming before God,
confessing that wherein we have wronged Him, and
bringing forth fruit meet for repentance, we must bring
and plead Christ in the glory of His person, in all the
perfection of His holy obedience, as our Guilt-Offering.
And therewith the ancient promise to the penitent
Israelite becomes ours (vi. 7), "The priest shall make
atonement for him before the Lord, and he shall be
forgiven; concerning whatsoever he doeth so as to be
guilty thereby."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<h3><em>THE PRIESTS' PORTIONS.</em></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lev.</span> vi. 16-18, 26; vii. 6-10, 14, 31-36.</p>


<p>After the law of the guilt-offering follows a
section (vi. 8-vii. 38) with regard to the offerings
previously treated, but addressed especially to the
priests, as the foregoing were specially directed to the
people. Much of the contents of this section has
already passed before us, in anticipation of its order in
the book, as this has seemed necessary in order to a
complete exposition of the several offerings. An important
part of the section, however, relating to the
portion of the offerings which was appointed for the
priests, has been passed by until now, and must claim
our brief attention.</p>

<p>In the verses indicated above, it is ordered that of the
meal-offerings, the sin-offerings, and the guilt-offerings,
all that was not burnt, as also the wave-breast and
the heave-shoulder of the peace-offerings, should be
for Aaron and his sons. In particular, it is directed
that the priest's portion of the sin-offering and the
guilt-offering shall be eaten by "the priest that maketh
atonement therewith" (vii. 7); and that of the meal-offerings
prepared in the oven, the frying-pan, or the
baking-pan, all that is not burned upon the altar,
according to the law of chap. ii., shall be eaten by "the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
priest that offereth it;" and that of every meal-offering
mingled with oil, or dry, the same part "shall all the
sons of Aaron have, one as well as another" (vii. 9,
10). Of the burnt-offering, all the flesh being burned,
the hide alone fell to the officiating priest as his perquisite
(vii. 8).</p>

<p>These regulations are explained in the concluding
verses of the section (vii. 35, 36) as follows, "This
is the anointing-portion of Aaron, and the anointing-portion
of his sons, out of the offerings of the Lord
made by fire, in the day when he presented them to
minister unto the Lord in the priest's office; which the
Lord commanded to be given them of the children of
Israel, in the day that he anointed them. It is a due
for ever throughout their generations."</p>

<p>Hence, it is plain that this use which was to be made
of certain parts of certain offerings does not touch the
question of the consecration of the whole to God. The
whole of each offering is none the less wholly accepted
and appropriated by God, that He designates a part of
it to the maintenance of the priesthood. That even as
thus used by the priest it is used by him as something
belonging to God, is indicated by the phrase used, "it
is most holy" (vi. 17); expressive words, which in the
law of the offerings always have a technical use, as
denoting those things of which only the sons of Aaron
might partake, and that only in the holy place. In the
case of the meal-offering, its peculiarly sacred character
as belonging, the whole of it, exclusively to God, is
further marked by the additional injunctions that it
should be "eaten <em>without leaven</em> in a holy place" (vi.
16); and that whosoever touched these offerings should
be holy (vi. 18); that is, he should be as a man
separated to God, under all the restrictions (doubtless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
without the privileges,) which belonged to the priesthood,
as men set apart for God's service. In the
eating of their portion of the various offerings by the
priests, we are to recognise no official act: we simply
see the servants of God supported by the bread of His
table.</p>

<p>This last thought, which is absent in the case of no
one of the offerings,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> is brought out with special clearness
and fulness in the ceremonial connected with the
peace-offerings (vii. 28-34). In this case, certain parts,
the right thigh (or shoulder?) and the breast, are
set apart as the due of the priest. The selection of
these is determined by the principle which marks all
the Levitical legislation: God and those who represent
Him are to be honoured by the consecration of the best
of everything. In the animals used upon the altar,
these were regarded as the choice parts, and are indeed
referred to as such in other Scriptures. But, in order
that neither the priest nor the people may imagine that
the priest receives these as a man from his fellow-men,
but may understand that they are given to God,
and that it is from God that the priest now receives
them, as His servant, fed from His table; to this end,
certain ceremonies were ordained to be used with these
parts; the breast was to be "heaved," the thigh was
to be "waved," before the Lord. What was the
meaning of these actions?</p>

<p>The breast was to be "heaved;" that is, elevated
heavenward. The symbolic meaning of this act can
scarcely be missed. By it, the priest acknowledged
his dependence upon God for the supply of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
sacrificial food, and, again, by this act consecrated it
anew to Him as the One that sitteth in the heavens.</p>

<p>But God is not only the One that "sitteth in the
heavens;" He is the God who has condescended also
to dwell among men, and especially in the tent of
meeting in the midst of Israel. And thus, as by the
elevation of the breast heavenward, God, the Giver,
was recognised as the One enthroned in heaven, so
by the "waving" of the thigh, which, as the rabbis
tell us, was a movement backward and forward, to and
from the altar, He was recognised also as Jehovah, who
had condescended from heaven to dwell in the midst
of His people. Like the "heaving," so the "waving,"
then, was an act of acknowledgment and consecration
to God; the former, to God, as in heaven, the God of
creation; the other, to God, as the God of the altar,
the God of redemption. And that this is the true
significance of these acts is illustrated by the fact that
in the Pentateuch, in the account of the gold and
silver brought by the people for the preparation of the
tabernacle (Exod. xxxv. 22), the same word is used to
describe the presentation of these offerings which is
here used of the wave-offering.</p>

<p>And so in the peace-offering the principle is amply
illustrated upon which the priests received their dues.
The worshippers bring their offerings, and present
them, not to the priest, but through him to God; who,
then, having used such parts as He will in the service
of the sanctuary, gives again such parts of them as He
pleases to the priests.</p>

<p>The lesson of these arrangements lies immediately
before us. They were intended to teach Israel, and,
according to the New Testament, are also designed to
teach us, that it is the will of God that those who give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
up secular occupations to devote themselves to the
ministry of His house should be supported by the free-will
offerings of God's people. Very strange indeed it
is to hear a few small sects in our day denying this.
For the Apostle Paul argues at length to this effect, and
calls the attention of the Corinthians (1 Cor. ix. 13, 14)
to the fact that the principle expressed in this ordinance
of the law of Moses has not been set aside, but holds
good in this dispensation. "Know ye not that they
which ... wait upon the altar have their portion with
the altar? Even so did the Lord ordain that they
which proclaim the Gospel should live of the Gospel."
The principle plainly covers the case of all such as
give up secular callings to devote themselves to the
ministry of the Word, whether to proclaim the Gospel
in any of the great mission fields, or to exercise the
pastorate of the local church. Such are ever to be
supported out of the consecrated offerings of God's
people.</p>

<p>To point in disparagement of modern "hireling"
ministers and missionaries, as some have done, to the
case of Paul, who laboured with his own hands, that he
might not be chargeable to those to whom he ministered,
is singularly inapt, seeing that in the chapter above
referred to he expressly vindicates his right to receive
of the Corinthians his support, and in this Second
Epistle to them even seems to express a doubt (2 Cor.
xii. 13) whether in refusing, as he did, to receive support
from them, he had not done them a "wrong,"
making them thus "inferior to the rest of the churches,"
from whom, in fact, he did receive such material aid
(Phil. iv. 10, 16).</p>

<p>And if ever claims of this kind upon our benevolence
and liberality seem to be heavy, and if to nature the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
burden is sometimes irksome, we shall do well to
remember that the requirement is not of man, and not
of the Church, but of God. It comes to us with the
double authority of the Old and New Testament, of the
Law and the Gospel. And it will certainly help us all
to give to these ends the more gladly, if we keep that
in mind which the Levitical law so carefully kept before
Israel, that the giving was to be regarded by them as
not to the priesthood, but to the Lord, and that in
our giving outwardly to support the ministry of God's
Word, we give, really, to the Lord Himself. And it
stands written (Matt. x. 42): "Whosoever shall give
to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold
water only, ... he shall in no wise lose his reward."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<h3><em>THE CONSECRATION OF AARON AND HIS SONS,
AND OF THE TABERNACLE.</em></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lev.</span> viii. 1-36.</p>


<p>The second section of the book of Leviticus (viii.
1-x. 20) is historical, and describes (viii.) the
consecration of the tabernacle and of Aaron and his
sons, (ix.) their induction into the duties of their office,
and, finally (x.), the terrible judgment by which the
high sanctity of the priestly office and of the tabernacle
service was very solemnly impressed upon them and all
the people.</p>

<p>First in order (chap. viii.) is described the ceremonial
of consecration. We read (vv. 1-4): "And the
Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Take Aaron and his
sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil,
and the bullock of the sin offering, and the two rams,
and the basket of unleavened bread; and assemble thou
all the congregation at the door of the tent of meeting.
And Moses did as the Lord commanded him; and the
congregation was assembled at the door of the tent of
meeting."</p>

<p>These words refer us back to Exod. xxviii., xxix., in
which are recorded the full directions previously given
for the making of the garments and the oil of anointing,
and for the ceremonial of the consecration of the priests.
The law of offerings having been delivered, Moses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
now proceeds to consecrate Aaron and his sons to the
priestly office, according to the commandment given;
and to this end, by Divine direction, he orders "all the
congregation" to be assembled "at the door of the tent
of meeting." In this last statement some have seen
a sufficient reason for rejecting the whole account as
fabulous, insisting that it is palpably absurd to suppose
that a congregation numbering some millions could be
assembled at the door of a single tent! But, surely,
if the words are to be taken in the ultra-literal sense
required in order to make out this difficulty, the impossibility
must have been equally evident to the
supposed fabricator of the fiction; and it is yet more
absurd to suppose that he should ever have intended
his words to be pressed to such a rigid literality. Two
explanations lie before us, either of which meets the
supposed difficulty; the one, that endorsed by Dillmann,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
that the congregation was gathered in their
appointed representatives; the other, that which refuses
to see in the words a statement that every individual
in the nation was literally "at the door," and further
reminds us that, inasmuch as the ceremonies of the
consecration are said to have continued seven days,
we are not, by the terms of the narrative, required to
believe that all, in any sense, were present, either at
the very beginning or at any one time during that
week. It is not too much to say that by a captious
criticism of this kind, any narrative, however sober,
might be shown to be absurd.</p>

<p>The consecration ceremonial was introduced by a
solemn declaration made by Moses to assembled Israel,
that the impressive rites which they were now about to
witness, were of Divine appointment. We read (ver.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
5), "Moses said unto the congregation, This is the
thing which the Lord hath commanded to be done."</p>

<p>Just here we may pause to note the great emphasis
which the narrative lays upon this fact of the Divine
appointment of all pertaining to these consecration rites.
Not only is this Divine ordination of all thus declared
at the beginning, but in connection with each of the
chief parts of the ceremonial the formula is repeated,
"as the Lord commanded Moses." Also, at the close
of the first day's rites, Moses twice reminds Aaron
and his sons that this whole ritual, in all its parts, is
for them an ordinance of God, and is to be regarded
accordingly, upon pain of death (vv. 34, 35). And
the narrative of the chapter closes (ver. 36) with the
words, "Aaron and his sons did all the things which
the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses." Twelve
times in this one chapter is reference thus made to the
Divine appointment of these consecration rites.</p>

<p>This is full of significance and instruction. It is of
the highest importance in an apologetic way. For it
is self-evident that this twelvefold affirmation, twelve
times directly contradicts the modern theory of the late
origin and human invention of the Levitical priesthood.
There is no evading of the issue which is thus placed
squarely before us. To talk of the inspiration from
God, in any sense possible to that word, of a writing
containing such affirmations, so numerous, formal, and
emphatic, if the critics referred to are right, and these
affirmations are all false, is absurd. There is no such
thing as inspired falsehood.</p>

<p>Again, a great spiritual truth is herein brought
before us, which concerns believers in all ages. It is
set forth in so many words in Heb. v. 4, where the
writer, laying down the essential conditions of priesthood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
specially mentions Divine appointment as one of
these; which he affirms as satisfied in the high-priesthood
of Christ: "No man taketh the honour unto himself,
but when he is called of God, even as was Aaron.
So Christ also glorified not Himself to be made a high
priest." Fundamental to Christian faith and life is this
thought: priesthood is not of man, but of God. In
particular, in all that Christ has done and is still doing
as the High Priest, in the true holiest, He is acting
under Divine appointment.</p>

<p>And we are hereby pointed to the truth of which some
may need to be reminded, that the work of our Lord in
our behalf, and that of the whole universe into which
sin has entered, has its cause and origin in the mind and
gracious will of the Father. It was in His incomprehensible
love, who appointed the priestly office, that the
whole work of atonement, and therewith purification
and full redemption, had its mysterious origin. The
thoughtful reader of the Gospels will hardly need to be
reminded how constantly our blessed Lord, in the days
of His high-priestly service upon earth, acted in all that
He did under the consciousness, often expressed, of His
appointment by the Father to this work. Thus, Aaron
in the solemn ceremonial of those days of consecration,
as ever afterward, doing "all the things which the Lord
commanded by the hand of Moses," in so doing fitly
represented Him who should come afterward, who said
of Himself (John vi. 38), "I came down from heaven, not
to do Mine own will, but the will of Him that sent Me."</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Levitical Priesthood and Tabernacle
as Types.</span></p>

<p>In order to any profitable study of the following
ceremonial, it is indispensable to have distinctly before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
us the New Testament teaching as to the typical significance
of the priesthood and the tabernacle. A few
words on this subject, therefore, seem to be needful
as preliminary to more detailed exposition. As to the
typical character of Aaron, as high priest, the New
Testament leaves us no room for doubt. Throughout
the Epistle to the Hebrews, Christ is held forth as the
true and heavenly High Priest, of whom Aaron, with his
successors, was an eminent type.</p>

<p>As regards the other priests, while it is true that,
considered in themselves, and without reference to the
high priest, each of them also, in the performance of his
daily functions in the tabernacle, was a lesser type of
Christ, as is intimated in Heb. x. 11, yet, as contrasted
with the high priest, who was ever one, while they were
many, it is plain that another typical reference must be
sought for the ordinary priesthood. What that may be
is suggested to us in several New Testament passages;
as, especially, in Rev. v. 10, where the whole body of
believers, bought by the blood of the slain Lamb, is
said to have been made "unto our God a kingdom and
priests;" with which may be compared Heb. xiii. 10,
where it is said, "We have an altar, whereof they have
no right to eat which serve the tabernacle"; words
which plainly assume the priesthood of all believers in
Christ, as the antitype of the priesthood of the Levitical
tabernacle.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>As to the typical meaning of the tabernacle, which
also is anointed in the consecration ceremonial, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
has been much difference of opinion. That it was
typical is declared, in so many words, in the Epistle to
the Hebrews (viii. 5), where the Levitical priests are
said to have served "that which is a copy and shadow
of the heavenly things;" as also ix. 24, where we
read, "Christ entered not into a holy place made with
hands, like in pattern to the true; but into heaven
itself, now to appear before the face of God for us."
But when we ask what then were "the heavenly things"
of which the tabernacle was "the copy and shadow,"
we have different answers.</p>

<p>Many have replied that the antitype of the tabernacle,
as of the temple, was the Church of believers; and, at
first thought, with some apparent Scriptural reason.
For it is certain that Christians are declared (1 Cor.
iii. 16) to be the temple of the living God; where, however,
it is to be noted that the original word denotes, not
the temple or tabernacle in general, but the "sanctuary"
or inner shrine&mdash;the "holy of holies." More to the point
is 1 Peter ii. 5, where it is said to Christians, "Ye also,
as living stones, are built up a spiritual house." Such
passages as these do certainly warrant us in saying that
the tabernacle, and especially the inner sanctuary, as
the special place of the Divine habitation and manifestation,
did in so far typify the Church.</p>

<p>But when we consider the tabernacle, not in itself,
but in relation to its priesthood and ministry, the explanation
fails, and we fall into confusion. As when
the priests are considered, not in themselves, but in
their relation to the high priest, we are compelled to
seek an antitype different from the Antitype of the
high priest, so in this case. To identify the typical
meaning of the tabernacle, considered as a part of a
whole system and order, with that of the priesthood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
who serve in it, is to throw that whole typical system
into confusion. Furthermore, this cannot be harmonised
with a number of New Testament expressions
with regard to the tabernacle and temple, as related to
the high priesthood of our Lord. It is hard to see, for
example, how the Church of believers could be properly
described as "things in the heavens." Moreover, we
are expressly taught (Heb. ix. 24), that the Antitype
of the Holy Place into which the high priest entered
every year, with blood, was "heaven itself," "the presence
of God;" and again, His ascension to the right
hand of God is described (Heb. iv. 14, R.V.), with
evident allusion to the passing of the high priest
through the Holy Place into the Holiest, as a passing
"<em>through</em> the heavens;" and also (Heb. ix. 11), as an
entering into the Holy Place, "through the greater and
more perfect tabernacle." These expressions exclude
reference to the Church of Christ as the antitype of
the earthly tabernacle.</p>

<p>Others, again, have regarded the tabernacle as a type
of the human nature of Christ, referring in proof to
John ii. 19-21, where our Lord speaks of "the temple
of His body;" and also to Heb. x. 19, 20, where it is
said that believers have access to the Holiest "by a
new and living way, which He dedicated for us through
the veil, that is to say, His flesh."</p>

<p>As regards the first of these passages, we should
note that the original word is, again, not the word for
the temple in general, but that which is invariably used
to denote the inner sanctuary, as the special shrine of
Jehovah's presence: so that it really gives us no warrant
for affirming that the tabernacle, <em>as a whole</em>, was a
type of our Lord's humanity; nor, on that supposition,
does it seem possible to explain the meaning of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
three parts into which the tabernacle was divided.
And the second passage referred to is no more to
the point. For the writer had only a little before
described the tabernacle as a "pattern of things in
the heavens;" words which, surely, could not be applied
to the humanity in which our Lord appeared in His
incarnation and humiliation,&mdash;a humanity which was
not a thing "of the heavens," but of the earth. The
reference to the "flesh" of Christ, as being the veil
through which He passed into the Holiest (Heb. x.
19, 20) is merely by way of illustration, and not of
typical interpretation. The thought of the inspired
writer appears to be this: Just as, in the Levitical
tabernacle, the veil must be parted before the high
priest could go into the Holiest Place, even so was it
necessary that the flesh of our Lord should be rent in
order that thus, through death, it might be possible for
Him to enter into the true holiest. The thought has
been happily expressed by Delitzsch, thus: "While
He was with us here below, the weak, limit-bound, and
mortal flesh which He had assumed for our sakes hung
like a curtain between Him and the Divine sanctuary
into which He would enter; and in order to such
entrance, this curtain had to be withdrawn by death,
even as the high priest had to draw aside the temple
veil in order to make his entry to the Holy of
Holies."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Not to review other opinions on this matter, the
various expressions used constrain us to regard the
tabernacle as typifying the universe itself, measured
and appointed in all its parts by infinite wisdom, as the
abode of Him who "filleth immensity with His presence,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
the place of the Divine manifestation, and the abode
of His holiness. In the outer court, where the victims
were offered, we have this world of sense in which we
live, in which our Lord was offered in the sight of all;
in the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies, the unseen
and heavenly worlds, through the former of which our
Lord is represented as having passed (Heb. iv. 14,
ix. 11) that He might appear with His blood in the true
Holiest, where God in the innermost shrine of His glory
"covereth Himself with light as with a garment." For
this cosmical dwelling-place of the Most High God has
been defiled by sin, which, as it were, has profaned the
whole sanctuary; for we read (Col. i. 20), that not only
"things upon the earth," but also "things in the
heavens," are to be "reconciled" through Christ, even
"through the blood of His cross;" and, still more
explicitly, to the same effect (Heb. ix. 23), that as the
typical "copies of the things in the heavens" needed
to be cleansed with the blood of bullocks and of
goats, so "it was necessary that ... the heavenly
things themselves should be cleansed with better
sacrifices than these." And so, at this present time,
Christ, as the High Priest of this cosmical tabernacle,
"not made with hands," having offered His great
sacrifice for sins for ever, is now engaged in carrying
out His work of cleansing the people of God, and the
earthly and the heavenly sanctuary, to the uttermost
completion.</p>

<p>With these preliminary words, which have seemed
essential to the exposition of these chapters, we
are now prepared to consider the ceremonial of
the consecration of the priesthood and tabernacle,
and the spiritual meaning which it was intended to
convey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Washing with Water.</span></p>

<p class="center">viii. 6.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with
water."</p></blockquote>

<p>The consecration ceremonies consisted of four parts,
namely, the Washing, the Investiture, the Anointing,
and the Sacrifices. Of these, first in order was the
<em>Washing</em>. We read that "Moses"&mdash;acting throughout,
we must remember, as Mediator, representing God&mdash;"brought
Aaron and his sons, and washed them with
water." The meaning of this act is so evident as not to
have been called in question. Washing ever signifies
cleansing; the ceremonial cleansing of the body, therefore,
in symbol ever represents the inward purification
of the spirit.</p>

<p>Of this usage the Biblical illustrations are very
numerous. Thus, the spiritual purification of Israel
in the latter day is described (Isa. iv. 4) by the same
word as is used here, as a washing away of "the filth
of the daughters of Zion" by the Lord. So, again, in
the New Testament, we read that Christ declared unto
Nicodemus that in order to see the kingdom of God a
man must be born again, "of water and the Spirit," and
in the Epistle to Titus (iii. 5) we read of a cleansing of
the Church "with the washing (<em>marg.</em>, laver) of water,
by the Word," even the "washing of regeneration."
The symbolism in this case, therefore, points to cleansing
from the defilement of sin as a fundamental condition of
priesthood. As regards our Lord indeed, such cleansing
was no more needed for His high priesthood than was
the sin-offering for Himself; for in His holy incarnation,
though He took our nature indeed with all the consequences
and infirmities consequent on sin He was yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
"without sin." But all the more it was necessary in
the symbolism that if Aaron was to typify the sinless
Christ of God he must be cleansed with water, in type
of the cleansing of human nature, without which no
man can approach to God. And in that not only Aaron,
but also his sons, the ordinary priests, were thus
cleansed, we are in the ordinance significantly pointed
to the deep spiritual truth that they who are called to
be priests to God must be qualified for this office, first
of all, by the cleansing of their human nature through
the washing of regeneration, by the power of the Holy
Ghost.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Investiture.</span></p>

<p class="center">viii. 7-9.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle,
and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he
girded him with the cunningly woven band of the ephod, and bound
it unto him therewith. And he placed the breastplate upon him: and
in the breastplate he put the Urim and the Thummim. And he set the
mitre upon his head: and upon the mitre, in front, did he set the
golden plate, the holy crown; as the Lord commanded Moses."</p></blockquote>

<p>The next ceremony of the consecration was the Investiture
of Aaron with his official, high-priestly robes,
as they had been appointed of God to be made (Exod.
xxviii.). The investiture of the sons of Aaron significantly
takes place only after the anointing of the
tabernacle, and of Aaron as high priest. Of the investiture
of Aaron we read in vv. 7-9, above.</p>

<p>As these garments were official, we must needs regard
them as symbolical; a thought which is the more
emphasised by the very minute and special directions
given by the Lord for making them. Nothing was left
to the fancy of man; all was prescribed by the Lord.
The official robes of the high priest consisted of eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
pieces, four of which, the coat, the girdle, the turban
(or "mitre"), and the breeches, were, with the exception
of the turban, of white linen, and identical in every
respect with the official dress of the ordinary priests.</p>

<p>Four pieces more were peculiar to himself, the special
insignia of his office, and unlike the dress of the
ordinary priest, were richly made in gold and various
colours, "garments for glory and for beauty." These
were: the robe of the ephod, made all of blue, with a
border of pendant pomegranates and golden bells in
alternation; the ephod itself consisting of two pieces,
broidered in gold and blue, purple, scarlet, and fine
white linen, the one hanging in front, the other behind,
over the robe of the ephod, and joined on the shoulders
with two onyx stones, on which were graven the names
of the twelve tribes, six on the one shoulder and six
on the other; it was girt about him with a girdle of the
same material and colours. The third was the breast-plate,
which was a double square of the same material
and colours as the ephod, within the fold of which, as
it hung from his shoulders by golden chains, was
placed the Urim and the Thummim, whatever these
may have been, and upon the front of which were set
twelve precious stones, on which, severally, were engraved
the names of the twelve tribes of the children
of Israel. And the fourth and last article of his attire
was "the golden plate, the holy crown;" a band of
gold bound about his forehead over the turban, with
blue lace, on which were engraven the words, "Holiness
to Jehovah."</p>

<p>This dress of the high priest represented him, in the
first place, as the appointed minister of the <em>tabernacle</em>.
The number of pieces, twice four, like the four of the
common priests' attire, answered to the four which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
represented in the ground plan of the tabernacle, quadrangular
both in its form as a whole and in its several
parts, the Holy of Holies being a perfect cube; four
being in Scripture constantly the number which symbolises
the universe, as created by God and bearing
witness to Him. So also the garments of the high
priest marked him as the minister of the tabernacle
by their colours, also four in number, and the same as
those of the latter, namely, blue, purple, scarlet, and
white.</p>

<p>But the official robes of the high priest marked
him, in the second place, as the servant of <em>the God
of the tabernacle</em>, whose livery he wore. For these
colours, various modifications of light, all thus had a
symbolic reference to the God of light, who made the
universe of which the Mosaic tabernacle was a type. Of
these, the blue, the colour of the overarching heaven,
has been in many lands and religions naturally regarded
as the colour symbolising God, as the God of
the heaven, bowing to the earth in condescending love
and self-revelation. In like manner, we find it repeatedly
recurring in the symbolic manifestations of
Jehovah in the Holy Scriptures, where it always brings
God before us with special reference to His condescending
love as entering into covenant with man, and revealing
for their good His holy law.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The purple, as
will occur to every one, is everywhere recognised as the
colour of royalty, and therefore symbolised the kingly
exaltation and majesty of God, as the Ruler of heaven
and earth. The scarlet reminds us at once of the
colour of blood, which stands in the very foreground of
the Mosaic symbolism as the symbol of life, and thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
points us to the conception of God, as the essentially
Living One, who is Himself the sole primal source of all
life, whether physical or spiritual, in the creature. No
one can mistake, again, the symbolic meaning of the
white, which, not only in the Scripture, but among all
nations, has ever been the symbol of purity and holiness,
and thus represented the high priest as the minister of
God, as the Most Holy One. By this investiture, therefore,
Aaron was symbolically constituted the minister
of the tabernacle, on the one hand, and of God, on the
other; and, in particular, of God as the God of revelation,
in covenant with Israel; of God as the Most High,
the King of Israel; of God as the God of life, the
Giver of life in the redemption of Israel; and, finally, of
God as the Most Holy, the God "who is light," and
"with whom is no darkness at all."</p>

<p>The "robe of the ephod" was woven in one piece,
and all of blue. In that it was thus without seam, was
symbolised the wholeness and absolute integrity necessary
to him who should bear the high priestly office.
In that it was made all of blue, the colour which symbolised
the God of heaven as manifesting Himself to
Israel in condescending love, in the holy law and covenant,
this robe of the ephod specially marked the high
priest as the minister of Jehovah and of His revealed
law.</p>

<p>The ephod, which depended from the shoulders before
and behind, according to the usage of Scripture, was
the garment specially significant of rule and authority;
a thought which reached full expression in the breast-plate
which was fastened to it, which contained the
Urim and Thummim, by which God's will was made
known to Israel in times of perplexity, and was called
"the breast-plate of judgment."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>The ornamentation of these garments had also a
symbolic meaning, though it may not be in each instance
equally clear. In that the high priest, as thus robed,
bore upon the ephod and the breast-plate of judgment,
graven on precious stones, the names of the twelve
tribes of Israel, he was marked as one who in all his
high-priestly work before and with God, presented and
represented Israel. In that the names were engraven
upon precious stones was signified the exceeding preciousness
of Israel in God's sight, as His "peculiar
treasure." In that, again, they were worn upon his
shoulders, Aaron was represented to Israel as upholding
and bearing them before God in the strength of his
office; in that he wore their names upon his breast, he
was represented as also bearing them upon his heart in
love and affection.</p>

<p>The symbolic meaning of the pomegranates and
golden bells, which formed the border of the robe of the
ephod, is not quite so clear. But we may probably
find a hint as to their significance in the Divine direction
as to the border of blue which every Israelite was
to wear upon the bottom of his garment (Numb. xv. 39).
The purpose of this is said to be that it might be for
a continual reminder of the law: "It shall be unto you
for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember
all the commandments of the Lord, and do them." If
then this border in the garment of each individual
member of the priestly nation was designed symbolically
to mark them as the keepers of the law of
the God of heaven, we may safely infer an analogous
meaning in the similar border to the official
garment of the high priest. And if so, then we shall
perhaps not be far out of the way if in this case we
follow Jewish tradition in regarding the pomegranate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
a fruit distinguished by being filled to the full with
seeds, as the symbol, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i>, of the law of commandments,
the words of the living God, as "incorruptible
seed," endowed by Him with vital energy and
power.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>As for the bells, we naturally think at once of the
common use of the bell to give a signal, and announce
what one may be concerned to know. So we read of
these golden bells (Exod. xxviii. 35), "the sound thereof
shall be heard when he goeth in unto the holy place
before the Lord ... that he die not."</p>

<p>These golden bells in the border of his garment,
between each pair of pomegranates, thus announced
him as officially appearing before God as the fulfiller
of the law of commandments, and as, for this reason,
acceptable to God in the execution of his high-priestly
functions.</p>

<p>As to the Urim and Thummim, "Light and Perfection,"
which were apparently placed within the fold of
the breast-plate of judgment, as the tables of the law
within the ark of the covenant, there has been in all
ages much debate; but what they were cannot be said
to have been certainly determined. Most probable
appears the opinion that they were two sacred lots,
which on solemn occasions were used by the high
priest for determining the will of God. So much, in
any case, is clear from the Scriptures, that in some way
through them the will of God as the King of Israel
was made known to the high priest, for the direction
of the nation in doubtful matters. Most fitly, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
they were placed within the breast-plate of judgment,
which, indeed, may have received this name from this
circumstance. The high priest, therefore, as the bearer
of the Urim and Thummim, was set forth, in accordance
with the meaning of these words, as one who
in virtue of his office received perfect enlightenment
from God as to His will, in all that concerned Israel's
action.</p>

<p>The plate of graven gold, called the "holy crown,"
was bound by Moses with a lace of blue upon the
mitre of Aaron in front. The precious metal here, as
elsewhere in the official garments of the high priest,
and in the tabernacle, was symbolic of the boundless
riches of the glory of the God of Israel, whose minister
the high priest was. The special significance, however,
of this holy crown, is found in the words which
appeared upon it, "Holiness to Jehovah." This was
a continual visible mark and reminder of the fact that
the high priest, in all that he was, and in all that he
did, was a person in the highest possible sense consecrated
to Jehovah, the heavenly King of Israel, whose
livery he wore. And in that this golden plate with
this inscription is called his "crown," it is further suggested
that in this last-named fact is found the crowning
glory and dignity of the high priest's office. He is
the minister of the God of Israel, Jehovah, whose own
supreme glory is just this, that He is holy. In the
directions given for this crown in Exod. xxviii. 36-38
it is said that in virtue of his wearing this, or, rather,
in virtue of the fact thus set forth, "Aaron shall bear
the iniquity of the holy things which the children of
Israel shall hallow in all their holy gifts; and it shall
always be upon his forehead, that they may be accepted
before the Lord." That is, even Israel's consecrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
things, their holiest gifts, are yet defiled by the ever
abiding sinfulness of those who offer them; but they
are nevertheless graciously accepted, as being offered by
Aaron, himself "holy to the Lord."</p>

<p>Such then appears to have been the symbolic meaning
of these "garments for glory and for beauty," with
which Moses now robed Aaron, in token of his investiture
with the manifold dignities of the exalted office to
which God had called him. But we must not forget
that we are not, in all this, dealing merely with matters
of antiquarian or archæological interest. Nothing is
plainer than the teaching of the New Testament, that
Aaron, as the high priest, not by accident, but by
Divine intention, prefigured Christ. In all the directions
given concerning his investiture with his office,
and the work which, as high priest, he had to do, the
Holy Ghost intended to prefigure, directly or indirectly,
something concerning the person, office, and work of
Jesus Christ, as our heavenly High Priest, the Fulfiller
of all these types. As Aaron appears in his fourfold
high-priestly garments of four colours, which represented
him as the minister, on the one hand, of the tabernacle,
and, on the other, of the God of Israel, the Inhabitant
of the tabernacle, so are we reminded how Christ is
appointed as the "Minister of the greater and more
perfect tabernacle, not made with hands" (Heb. ix. 11),
the earth, the heaven, and the heaven of heavens, to
reconcile, by the offering of His blood, "both the things
which are on earth and those which are in the heavens"
(Col. i. 20). We look upon the blue robe of the ephod,
and remember how Christ is made a minister of "a
better covenant, enacted upon better promises" (Heb.
viii. 6), representing, as that old covenant did not, the
fulness of the revelation of God's condescending love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
and saving mercy. So also the inwoven scarlet reminds
us how Christ, again, as the great High Priest, is the
minister of the God of life, and is also Himself life and
the Giver of life to all His people. We look upon the
high priest's purple and gold, and are reminded again
that Christ, the High Priest, is also invested with regal
power and dominion, all authority being given unto
Him in heaven and on earth (Matt. xxviii. 18).</p>

<p>Again, we look on the ephod of fine linen, inwoven
with blue, and scarlet, and purple, and gold, with its
girdle, symbolising service, and its pendant breast-plate
of judgment, and are reminded how Christ in all the
relations thus pertaining to Him as High Priest, is the
Ruler and the Judge of His people, who, as the bearer
of the true Urim and Thummim, is not only Priest, and
King, and Judge, but also, and in order to the salvation
of His people, their Prophet, continually revealing
unto those who seek Him, the will of God for their
direction and guidance in every emergency of life. The
girdle, the symbol of service, brings to mind, again, how
in all this He is the Servant of the Lord, serving the
Father in saving us.</p>

<p>The symbolism of the pomegranates and the golden
bells reminds us, for the strengthening of our faith,
how our exalted High Priest, who appears before God
in our behalf in the Holiest, appears there as the great
Preserver and Fulfiller of the Divine law, supremely
qualified, no less by His supreme merit than by Divine
appointment, to urge our needs with prevalence before
God, His very presence in the heavenly sanctuary vocal
with sweet music. Did Aaron bear the names of the
twelve tribes of Israel on his shoulders and on his
breast before God continually? Even so does his
great Antitype bear continually all His people before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
God, as He executes His high-priestly office; and this,
too, not merely in a vague and general way, but tribe
by tribe, community by community, each with its peculiar
case and special need; nay, we may say even
more; each individual, as such, is thus borne continually
on the shoulders and the breast of the heavenly
Priest; on His shoulders He bears them, to support
them by His power; on His heart, in tenderest love and
sympathy. And so often as we are distressed and
discouraged by the consciousness of defilement still
pertaining even to the holiest of our holy things, consecration
ever imperfect at the best, we may bethink
ourselves of the golden crown which Aaron wore, and
its inscription, and remember how the Lord Jesus is in
fullest reality "holy to the Lord;" so that we may take
heart of grace as, with full reason and right, we apply
to Him what is said of this crown of holiness on Aaron's
brow: "The crown of holiness is ever on His forehead,
and He shall bear the iniquity of the holy things which
we shall hallow in all our holy gifts; it is always on
His forehead, that our works may be accepted before the
Lord." And so we are taught by this symbolism ever
to look away from all conscious defilement and sin to
the infinite holiness of the person of the Lord Jesus, as
He continually appears before God as High Priest in
our behalf, the all-sufficient Surety for the acceptance
of our persons and of our imperfect works, for His
own sake.</p>

<p>The investiture, as also the anointing, of the sons
of Aaron, followed the robing and anointing of Aaron.
We read (ver. 13): "Moses brought Aaron's sons,
and clothed them with coats, and girded them with
girdles, and bound head-tires upon them; as the Lord
commanded Moses."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>To the three articles of their attire here mentioned,
must be added the "linen breeches" (Exod. xxviii. 42,
43); so that they also, in the several parts of their
official vestments, bore the number four, the signature
of the creaturely, as represented in the tabernacle.
All was of pure white linen, signifying the holiness and
righteousness of those who should act as priests
before God. So once and again in the Apocalypse,
the same symbol is used to denote the spotless holiness
and righteousness of the blood-bought saints, who are
made "a kingdom and priests" unto God; as, for
instance, it is said of that same holy body, symbolised
as the bride of the Lamb, that "it was given unto her
that she should array herself in fine linen, bright and
pure: for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the
saints" (Rev. xix. 8).</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Anointing.</span></p>

<p class="center">viii. 10-12.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle
and all that was therein, and sanctified them. And he sprinkled
thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all
its vessels, and the laver and its base, to sanctify them. And he
poured of the anointed oil upon Aaron's head, and anointed him, to
sanctify him."</p></blockquote>

<p>Next in order came the anointing, first of the
tabernacle and all that pertained to its service, and
then the anointing of Aaron.</p>

<p>The anointing oil was made (Exod. xxx. 22-33) with
a perfume of choice spices, their number, four, the
sacred number so constantly recurring in the tabernacle.
To make or use this oil, except for the sacred purposes
of the sanctuary, was forbidden under penalty of being
cut off from the holy people. The purpose of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
anointing of the tabernacle and all within it, is declared
to be its consecration thereby to the service of Jehovah.
The altar, as a place of special sanctity, the place
where God had covenanted to meet with Israel, was
anointed seven times. For the number seven, compounded
of three, the signet number of the Godhead,
and four, the constant symbol of the creaturely, is
thus by eminence the sacred number, the number, in
particular, which is the sign and reminder of the
covenant of redemption; and so here it is with special
meaning that the altar, as being the place where God
had specially covenanted to meet with Israel as
reconciled through the blood of atonement, should
receive a sevenfold anointing.</p>

<p>After this, the anointing oil was poured on the head
of Aaron, to sanctify him.</p>

<p>As to the meaning of this part of the symbolic
service, there is little room for doubt. The "anointing"
is said to have been "to sanctify" or set apart to
the service of Jehovah him that was anointed. And,
inasmuch as oil, in the Holy Scriptures, is the constant
symbol of the Holy Spirit, it is taught hereby that consecration
is secured only through the anointing with the
Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>The direct typical reference of this part of the
ceremonial to Christ, will not be denied by any one for
whom the Scripture any longer has authority. For
Christ Himself quoted the words we find in Isa. lxi. 1,
as fulfilled in Himself: "The Spirit of the Lord God
is upon Me, because the Lord God hath anointed Me."
And the Apostle Peter afterward taught (Acts x. 38)
that God had "anointed Jesus with the Holy Ghost
and with power;" while the most common title of our
Lord, as "the Messiah" or "Christ," as we all know,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
though often forgetful of its meaning, simply means
"the Anointed One." So every time we use the word,
we unconsciously testify to the fulfilment of this type
of the anointing of Aaron as priest, as, afterward, of
the anointing of David as king, in Him. And as the
anointing of Aaron took place in the sight of all Israel,
assembled at the door of the tent of meeting, so in
the fulness of time was Jesus, in the sight of all the
multitude that waited on the baptism of John, after
having been washed with water, "to fulfil all righteousness,"
anointed from heaven, as "the Holy Ghost
descended in bodily form, as a dove," and abode
upon him (Luke iii. 22). And while, according to
Jewish tradition, the anointing oil was applied to the
ordinary priests only in small quantity and by the
finger, on the head of Aaron it was "poured;" in
which word, as suggested in Psalm cxxxiii. 2, we are
to understand a reference to the great copiousness
with which it was used. In which, again, the type
exactly corresponds to the Antitype. For while it is
true of all believers that they "have an anointing from
the Holy One" (1 John ii. 20), even as their Lord,
yet of Him alone is it true that unto Him the Spirit
"was not given by measure" (John iii. 34). And by
this Divine anointing with the Holy Spirit without
limit, was Jesus sanctified and qualified for the office
of High Priest for all His people.</p>

<p>The anointing of the tabernacle with the same holy
oil was according to a custom long before prevalent,
and however it may seem strange to any of us now,
will not have seemed strange to Israel. We read,
for instance (Gen. xxviii. 18), of the anointing of the
stone at Bethel by Jacob, by which he thus consecrated
it to be a stone of remembrance of the revelation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
God to him in that place. So by this anointing, the
tabernacle, with all that it contained, was "sanctified;"
that is, consecrated that so the use of these might be
made, through the power of the Holy Ghost, a means
of grace and blessing to Israel. And it was thus
anointed, and for this purpose, as being a "copy and
pattern of the heavenly things." By the ceremony
is signified to us, that by the power of the Holy Ghost,
through the high-priesthood of our Lord, the whole
universe and all that is in it has been consecrated
and endowed by God with virtue, to become a means
of grace and blessing to all believers, by His grace and
might who works "in all things and through all
things" to this end.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Consecration Sacrifices.</span></p>

<p class="center">viii. 14-32.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And he brought the bullock of the sin offering: and Aaron and his
sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock of the sin offering.
And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the horns
of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and
poured out the blood at the base of the altar, and sanctified it, to make
atonement for it. And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards,
and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses
burned it upon the altar. But the bullock, and its skin, and its flesh,
and its dung, he burnt with fire without the camp; as the Lord commanded
Moses. And he presented the ram of the burnt offering: and
Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram. And
he killed it: and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.
And he cut the ram into its pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the
pieces, and the fat. And he washed the inwards and the legs with
water; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt
offering for a sweet savour: it was an offering made by fire unto the
Lord; as the Lord commanded Moses. And he presented the other
ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands
upon the head of the ram. And he slew it; and Moses took of the
blood thereof, and put it upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the
thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
And he brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the
tip of their right ear, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and
upon the great toe of their right foot: and Moses sprinkled the blood
upon the altar round about. And he took the fat, and the fat tail,
and all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul of the liver,
and the two kidneys and their fat, and the right thigh: and out of the
basket of unleavened bread, that was before the Lord, he took one
unleavened cake, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and
placed them on the fat, and upon the right thigh: and he put the
whole upon the hands of Aaron, and upon the hands of his sons,
and waved them for a wave offering before the Lord. And Moses
took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the altar upon
the burnt offering: they were a consecration for a sweet savour: it
was an offering made by fire unto the Lord. And Moses took the
breast and waved it for a wave offering before the Lord: it was
Moses' portion of the ram of consecration; as the Lord commanded
Moses. And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which
was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, upon his garments,
and upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with him; and sanctified
Aaron, his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with
him. And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the
door of the tent of meeting: and there eat it and the bread that is in
the basket of consecration, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his
sons shall eat it. And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the
bread shall ye burn with fire."</p></blockquote>

<p>The last part of the consecration ceremonial was the
sacrifices. Each of the chief sacrifices of the law were
offered in order; first, a sin-offering; then, a burnt-offering;
then, a peace-offering, with some significant
variations from the ordinary ritual, adapting it to this
occasion; with which was conjoined, after the usual
manner, a meal-offering. A sin-offering was offered,
first of all; there had been a symbolical cleansing with
water, but still a sin-offering is required. It signified,
what so many in these days seem to forget, that in
order to our acceptableness before God, not only is
needed a cleansing of the defilement of nature by the
regeneration of the Holy Ghost, but also expiation for
the guilt of our sins. The sin-offering was first, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
guilt of Aaron and his sons must be thus typically
removed, before their burnt-offerings and their meal- and
peace-offerings can be accepted.</p>

<p>The peculiarities of the offerings as rendered on this
occasion are easily explained from the circumstances of
their presentation. Moses officiates, for this time only,
as specially delegated for this occasion, inasmuch as
Aaron and his sons are not yet fully inducted into their
office. The victim for the sin-offering is the costliest
ever employed: a bullock, as ordered for the sin of the
anointed priest. But the blood is not brought into the
Holy Place, as in the ritual for the offering for the high
priest, because Aaron is not yet fully inducted into
his office. Nor do Aaron and his sons eat of the flesh
of the sin-offering, as ordered in the case of other
sin-offerings whose blood is not brought within the Holy
Place; obviously, because of the principle which rules
throughout the law, that he for whose sin the sin-offering
is offered, must not himself eat of the flesh; it
is therefore burnt with fire, without the camp, that it
may not see corruption.</p>

<p>By this sin-offering, not only Aaron and his sons were
cleansed, but we read that hereby atonement was also
made "for the altar;" a mysterious type, reminding us
that, in some way which we cannot as yet fully understand,
sin has affected the whole universe: in such a
sense, that not only for man himself who has sinned, is
propitiation required, but, in some sense, even for the
earth itself, with the heavens. That in expounding the
meaning of this part of the ritual we do not go beyond
the Scripture is plain from such passages as Heb. ix. 23,
where it is expressly said that even as the tabernacle
and the things in it were cleansed with the blood of the
bullock, so was necessary that, not merely man, but "the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
heavenly things themselves," of which the tabernacle and
its belongings were the "copies," should be cleansed
with better sacrifices than these, even the offering of
Christ's own blood. So also we read in Col. i. 20, before
cited, that through Christ, even through the blood of
His cross, not merely persons, "but all <em>things</em>, whether
things on the earth, or things in the heavens," should
be reconciled unto God. Mysterious words these, no
doubt; but words which teach us at least so much
as this, how profound and far-reaching is the mischief
which sin has wrought, even our sin. Not merely the
sinning man must be cleansed with blood before he can
be made a priest unto God, but even nature, "made
subject to vanity" (Rom. viii. 20), for man's sin, needs
the reconciling blood before redeemed man can exercise
his priesthood unto God in the heavenly places. Evidently
we have here an estimate of the evil of sin which
is incomparably higher than that which is commonly
current among men; and we shall do well to conform
our estimate to that of God, who required atonement to
be made even for the earthen altar, to sanctify it.</p>

<p>Reconciliation being made by the sin-offering, next
in order came the burnt-offering, symbolic, as we have
seen, of the full consecration of the person of the offerer
to God; in this case of the full consecration of Aaron
and his sons to the service of God in the priesthood.
The ritual was according to the usual law, and requires
no further exposition.</p>

<p>The ceremonial culminated and was completed in
the offering of "the ram of consecration." The expression
is, literally, "the ram of fillings;" in which phrase
there is a reference to the peculiar ceremony described
in vv. 27, 28, in which certain portions of the victim
and of the meal-offering were placed by Moses on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
hands of Aaron and his sons, and waved by them for
a wave-offering; and afterwards burnt wholly on the
altar upon the burnt-offering, in token of their full
devotement to the Lord. Of these it is then added,
"they were a consecration" (<em>lit.</em> "fillings," <em>sc.</em> of hands,
"were these"). The meaning of the phrase and the
action it denoted is determined by its use in 1 Chron.
xxix. 5 and 2 Chron. xxix. 31, where it is used of
the bringing of the freewill-offerings by the people for
Jehovah. The ceremonial in this case therefore signified
the formal making over of the sacrifices into the charge
of Aaron and his sons, which henceforth they were to
offer; that they received them to offer them to and for
Jehovah, was symbolised by their presentation to be
waved before Jehovah, and further by their being
burnt upon the altar, as a sacrifice of sweet savour.</p>

<p>Another thing peculiar to this special consecration
sacrifice, was the use which was made of the blood,
which (ver. 23) was put upon the tip of Aaron's right
ear, upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the
great toe of his right foot. Although the solution is not
without difficulty, we shall probably not err in regarding
this as distinctively an act of consecration, signifying
that in virtue of the sacrificial blood, Aaron and his
sons were set apart to sacrificial service. It is applied
to the ear, to the hand, and the foot, and to the most
representative member in each case, to signify the
consecration of the whole body to the Lord's service
in the tabernacle; the ear is consecrated by the blood
to be ever attentive to the word of Jehovah, to receive
the intimations of His will; the hand, to be ever ready
to do the Lord's work; and the foot, to run on His
service.</p>

<p>Another peculiarity of this offering was in the wave-offering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
of Aaron and his sons. Not the breast, but
the thigh, and that together with the fat (ver. 27)
was waved before the Lord; and, afterward, not only
the fat was burnt upon the altar, according to the
law, but also the thigh, which in other cases was the
portion of the priest, was burnt with the fat and the
memorial of the meal-offering. The breast was afterward
waved, as the law commanded in the case of the
peace-offerings, but was given to Moses as his portion.
The last particular is easy to understand; Moses in
this ceremonial stands in the place of the officiating
priest, and it is natural that he should thus receive
from the Lord his reward for his service. As for the
thigh, which, when the peace-offering was offered by
one of the people, was presented to the Lord, and then
given to the officiating priest to be eaten, obviously
the law could not be applied here, as the priests themselves
were the bringers of the offering; hence the
only alternative was, as in the case of sin-offerings of
the holy place, to burn the flesh with fire upon the altar,
as "the food of Jehovah." The remainder of the flesh
was to be eaten by the priests alone as the offerers,
under the regulation for the thank-offering, except that
whatever remained until the next day was to be burnt;
a direction which is explained by the fact that the
sacrifice was to be repeated for seven days, so that
there could be no reason for keeping the flesh until the
third day. Last of all, it is to be noted that whereas
in the thank-offerings of the people, the offerer was
allowed to bring leavened bread for the sacrificial
feast, in the feast of the consecration of priests this was
not permitted; no doubt to emphasise the peculiar
sanctity of the office to which they were inducted.</p>

<p>With these modifications, it is plain that the sacrifice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
of consecration was essentially, not a guilt-offering, as
some have supposed, but a peace-offering. It is true
that a ram was enjoined as the victim instead of a lamb,
but the correspondence here with the law of the guilt-offering
is of no significance when we observe that
rams were also enjoined or used for peace-offerings on
other occasions of exceptional dignity and sanctity, as
in the peace-offerings for the nation, mentioned in the
following chapter, and the peace-offerings for the princes
of the tribes (Numb. vii.). Unlike the guilt-offering, but
after the manner of the other, the sacrifice was followed
by a sacrificial feast. That participation in this was
restricted to the priests, is sufficiently explained by
the special relation of this sacrifice to their own
consecration.</p>

<p>Before the sacrificial feast, however, one peculiar
ceremony still remained. We read (ver. 30): "Moses
took of the anointing oil, and of the blood (of the
peace-offering) which was upon the altar, and sprinkled
it upon Aaron, upon his garments, and upon his sons,
and upon his sons' garments with him; and sanctified
Aaron, his garments, and his sons, and his sons'
garments with him."</p>

<p>This sprinkling signified that now, through the
atoning blood which had been accepted before God
upon the altar, and through the sanctifying Spirit of
grace, which was symbolised by the anointing, thus
inseparably associated each with the other, they had
been brought into covenant relation with God regarding
the office of the priesthood. That this their covenant
relation to God concerned them, not merely as private
persons, but in their official character, was intimated
by the sprinkling, not only of their persons, but of the
garments which were the insignia of their priestly office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>All this completed, now followed the sacrificial feast.
We read that Moses now ordered Aaron and his sons
(ver. 31): "Boil the flesh at the door of the tent of
meeting: and there eat it and the bread that is in the
basket of consecration, as I commanded, saying,
Aaron and his sons shall eat it. And that which remaineth
of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn
with fire."</p>

<p>This sacrificial feast most fitly marked the conclusion
of the rites of consecration. Hereby it was signified,
first, that by this solemn service they were now brought
into a relation of peculiarly intimate fellowship with
Jehovah, as the ministers of His house, to offer His
offerings, and to be fed at His table. It was further
signified, that strength for the duties of this office
should be supplied to them by Him whom they were to
serve, in that they were to be fed of His altar. And,
finally, in that the ritual took the specific form of a
thank-offering, was thereby expressed, as was fitting,
their gratitude to God for the grace which had chosen
them and set them apart to so holy and exalted service.</p>

<p>These consecration services were to be repeated for
seven consecutive days, during which time they were
not to leave the tent of meeting,&mdash;obviously, that by no
chance they might contract any ceremonial defilement;
so jealously must the sanctity of everything pertaining
to the service be guarded.</p>

<p>The commandment was (vv. 33-35): "Ye shall not
go out from the door of the tent of meeting seven
days, until the days of your consecration be fulfilled:
for he shall consecrate you seven days. As hath been
done this day, so the Lord hath commanded to do,
to make atonement for you. And at the door of the
tent of meeting shall ye abide day and night seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
days, and keep the charge of the Lord, that ye die not:
for so I am commanded."</p>

<p>By the sevenfold repetition of the consecration
ceremonies was expressed, in the most emphatic
manner known to the Mosaic symbolism, the completeness
of the consecration and qualification of Aaron and
his sons for their office, and the fact also that, in virtue
of this consecration, they had come into a special
covenant relation with Jehovah concerning the priestly
office.</p>

<p>That these consecration sacrifices by which Aaron
and his sons were set apart to the priesthood, no less
than the preceding part of the ceremonial, pointed
forward to Christ and His priestly people as the Antitype,
it will be easy to see. As regards our Lord, in
Heb. vii. 28, the sacred writer applies to the consecration
of our Lord as high priest the very term which the
Seventy had used long before in this chapter of Leviticus
to denote this formal consecration, and represents the
consecration of the Son as the antitype of the consecration
of Aaron by the law: "the law appointeth men
high priests, having infirmity; but the word of the oath,
which was after the law, appointeth a Son, perfected
for evermore."</p>

<p>An exception, indeed, must be made, as regards our
Lord, in the case of the sin-offering; of whom it is said
(Heb. vii. 27), that He "needeth not ... like those
high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for His own
sins." But as regards the other two sacrifices, we can
see that in their distinctive symbolical import they
each bring before us essential elements in the consecration
of our Lord Jesus Christ as High Priest. In the
burnt-offering, we see Him consecrating Himself by
the complete self-surrender of Himself to the Father.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
In the offering of consecrations, we see Him in the
meal-offering of unleavened bread, offering in like
manner His most holy works unto the Father; and in
the sacrifice of the peace-offering, wherein Aaron ate
of the food of God's house in His presence, we see
Jesus in like manner as qualified for His high-priestly
work by His admission into terms of the most intimate
fellowship with the Father, and sustained for His work
by the strength given from Him, according to His own
word: "The living Father hath sent Me, and I live
because of the Father." In the formal "filling of
the hands" of Aaron with the sacrificial material, in
token of his endowment with the right to offer sacrifices
for sin for the sake of sinful men, we are reminded
how our Lord refers to the fact that He had received in
like manner authority from the Father to lay down His
life for His sheep, emphatically adding the words,
(John x. 18), "This commandment have I received of
My Father."</p>

<p>So also was the meaning of the collateral ceremonies
fully realised in Him. If Aaron was anointed with the
blood on ear, hand, and foot, by way of signifying that
the members of his body should be wholly devoted
unto God in priestly service, even so we are reminded
(Heb. x. 5, 7), that "when He cometh into the world
He saith, ... Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not,
but a body didst thou prepare for Me; ... Lo, I am
come to do Thy will, O God."</p>

<p>And so, as Aaron was at the end of the sacrifice
sprinkled with blood and oil, in token that God had now,
through the blood and the oil, entered into a covenant
of priesthood with him, so we find repeated reference
to the fact of such a solemn covenant and compact
between God and the High Priest of our profession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
summed up in the words of prophecy, "The Lord hath
sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever
after the order of Melchizedek."</p>

<p>So did this whole consecration ceremony, with the
exception only of such parts of it as had reference to
the sin of Aaron, point forward to the future investiture
of the Son of God with the high-priestly office, by God
the Father, that He might act therein for our salvation
in all matters between us and God. How can any who
have eyes to see all this, as opened out for us in the
New Testament, fail with fullest joy and thankfulness
to accept Christ, the Son of God, now passed into the
Holiest, as the High Priest of our profession? How
naturally to all such come the words of exhortation
with which is concluded the great argument upon
Christ's high-priesthood in the Epistle to the Hebrews
(x. 19-23): "Having therefore, brethren, boldness to
enter into the holy place by the blood of Jesus; ...
and having a great priest over the house of God; let
us draw near with a true heart, in fulness of faith,
having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience,
and our body washed with pure water: let us hold
fast the confession of our hope that it waver not; for
He is faithful that promised."</p>

<p>But not only was Aaron thus consecrated to be high
priest of the tabernacle, but his sons also, to be priests
under him in the same service. In this also the type
holds good. For when in Heb. ii. Christ is brought
before us as "the High Priest of our confession," He
is represented as saying (ver. 13), "Behold, I and the
children which God hath given me!" As Aaron had his
sons appointed to perform priestly functions under him
in the earthly tabernacle, so also his great Antitype
has "sons," called to priestly office under Him in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
heavenly tabernacle. Accordingly, we find that in the
New Testament, not any caste or class in the Christian
Church, but all believers, are represented as "a holy
priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to
God through Jesus Christ" (1 Peter ii. 5). To the
testimony of Peter corresponds that of John in the
Apocalypse, where in like manner believers are declared
to be priests unto God, and represented as also acting as
priests of God and of Christ in the age which is to come
after "the first resurrection"<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> (Rev. xx. 6). Hence
it is plain that according to the New Testament we
shall rightly regard the consecration of the sons of
Aaron as no less typical than that of Aaron himself.
It is typical of the consecration of all believers to priesthood
under Christ. It thus sets forth in symbol the
fact and the manner of our own consecration to ministrations
between lost men and God, in the age which
now is and that which is to come, in things pertaining
to sin and salvation, according to the measure to each
one of the gift of Christ.</p>

<p>As the consecration of Aaron's sons began with the
washing with pure water, so ours with "the washing
of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Ghost"
(Titus iii. 5). As Aaron's sons, thus washed, were then
invested in white linen, clean and pure, so for the
believer must the word be fulfilled (Isa. lxi. 10): "He
hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a
bridegroom decketh himself" (marg. "decketh as a
priest"). That is, the reality of our appointment of
God unto this high dignity must be visibly attested unto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
men by the righteousness of our lives. But whereas
the sons of Aaron were not clothed until first Aaron
himself had been clothed and anointed, it is signified
that the robing and anointing of Christ's people follows
and depends upon the previous robing and anointing
of their Head. Again, as Aaron's sons were also
anointed with the same holy oil as was Aaron, only in
lesser measure, so are believers consecrated to the
priestly office, like their Lord, by the anointing with the
Holy Ghost. The anointing of Pentecost follows and
corresponds to the anointing of the High Priest at the
Jordan with one and the same Spirit. This is another
necessary consecration mark, on which the New Testament
Scriptures constantly insist. As Jesus was
"anointed with the Holy Ghost and (thereby) with
power," so He Himself said to His disciples (Acts i. 8),
"Ye shall receive power, when the Holy Ghost is
come upon you;" which promise being fulfilled, Paul
could say (2 Cor. i. 21), "He that ... anointed us
is God;" and John (1 John ii. 20), to all believers,
"Ye have an anointing from the Holy One." And the
sacrificial symbols are also all fulfilled in the case of the
Lord's priestly people. For them, no less essential to
their consecration than the washing of the Holy Ghost,
is the removal of guilt by the great Sin-offering of
Calvary; which same offering, and true Lamb of God,
has also become their burnt-offering, their meal-offering,
and their sacrifice of consecrations, as it is written
(Heb. x. 10), that, by the will of God, "we have been
sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus
Christ once for all:" and that He also is become "our
peace," in that He has expiated our sins, and also given
Himself to us as our spiritual food; that so we may
derive daily strength for the daily service in the priest's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
office, by feeding on the Lamb of God, the true food
of the altar, given by God for our support. Also, as
the sons of Aaron, like Aaron himself, were anointed
with the blood of the peace-offering of consecration, on
the ear, the hand, and the foot, so has the blood of
the Lamb, in that it has brought us into peace with
God, set apart every true believer unto full surrender
of all the members of his body unto Him; ears, that
they may be quick to hear God's Word; hands, that
they may be quick to do it; feet, that they may only
run in the way of His commandments. And finally,
whereas the solemn covenant of priesthood into which
Aaron and his sons had entered with God, was sealed
and ratified by the sprinkling with the oil and the blood,
so by the unction of the Holy Spirit given to believers,
and the cleansing of the conscience by the blood, is it
witnessed and certified that they are a people called out
to enter into covenant of priestly service with the God
of all the earth and the heavens.</p>

<p>What searching questions as to personal experience
all this raises! What solemn thoughts throng into the
mind of every thoughtful reader! All this essential, if
we are to be indeed members of that royal priesthood,
who shall reign as priests of God and of Christ? Have
we then the marks, all of them? Let us not shrink
from the questions, but probe with them the innermost
depths of our hearts. Have we had the washing of
regeneration? If we think that we have had this,
then let us also remember that after the washing came
the investiture in white linen. Let us ask, Have we
then put on these white garments of righteousness?
All that were washed, were also clad in white; these
were their official robes, without which they could not
act as priests unto God. And there was also an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
anointing. Have we, in like manner, received the
anointing with the Holy Ghost, endowing us with power
and wisdom for service? Then, the sin-offering, the
burnt-offering, the peace-offering of consecration,&mdash;has
the Lamb of God been used by us in all these various
ways, as our expiation, our consecration, our peace,
and our life? And has the blood which consecrates
also been applied to ear, hand, and foot? Are we
consecrated in all the members of our bodies?</p>

<p>What questions these are! Truly, it is no light
thing to be a Christian; to be called and consecrated
to be, with and under the great High Priest, Jesus
Christ, a "priest unto God" in this life and in that
of "the first resurrection;" to deal between God and
men in matters of salvation. Have we well understood
what is our "high calling," and what the conditions
on which alone we may exercise our ministry?
To this may God give us grace, for Jesus' sake. Amen.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<h3><em>THE INAUGURATION OF THE TABERNACLE
SERVICE.</em></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lev.</span> ix. 1-24.</p>


<p>Aaron and his sons having now been solemnly
consecrated to the priestly office by the ceremonies
of seven days, their formal assumption of their
daily duties in the tabernacle was marked by a special
service suited to the august occasion, signalised at its
close by the appearance of the glory of Jehovah to
assembled Israel, in token of His sanction and approval
of all that had been done. It would appear that the
daily burnt-offering and meal-offering had been indeed
offered before this, from the time that the tabernacle
had been set up; in which service, however, Moses
had thus far officiated. But now that Aaron and his
sons were consecrated, it was most fitting that a
service should thus be ordered which should be a
complete exhibition of the order of sacrifice as it had
now been given by the Lord, and serve, for Aaron and
his sons in all after time, as a practical model of the
manner in which the divinely-given law of sacrifice
should be carried out.</p>

<p>The order of the day began with a very impressive
lesson of the inadequacy of the blood of beasts to take
away sin. For seven consecutive days a bullock had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
been offered for Aaron and his sons, and so far as
served the typical purpose, their consecration was complete.
But still Aaron and his sons needed expiating
blood; for before they could offer the sacrifices of the
day for the people, they are ordered yet again first of
all to offer a sin-offering for themselves. We read
(vv. 1, 2): "And it came to pass on the eighth day, that
Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of
Israel; and he said unto Aaron, Take thee a bull calf
for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering,
without blemish, and offer them before the Lord."</p>

<p>And then Aaron was commanded (vv. 3-5): "Unto
the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye
a he-goat for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb,
both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt
offering; and an ox and a ram for peace offerings, to
sacrifice before the Lord; and a meal offering mingled
with oil: for to-day the Lord appeareth unto you.
And they brought that which Moses commanded before
the tent of meeting: and all the congregation drew near
and stood before the Lord."</p>

<p>There is little in these directions requiring explanation.
Because of the exceptional importance of the
occasion, therefore, as in the feasts of the Lord, a
special sin-offering was ordered, and a burnt-offering,
besides the regular daily burnt-offering, meal-offering,
and drink-offering; and, in addition, peculiar to this
occasion, a peace-offering for the nation; which last
was evidently intended to signify that now on the
basis of the sacrificial worship and the mediation of a
consecrated priesthood, Israel was privileged to enter
into fellowship with Jehovah, the Lord of the tabernacle.
No peace-offering was ordered for Aaron and his sons,
as, according to the law of the peace-offering, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
would themselves take part in that of the people. The
sin-offering prescribed for the people was, not a kid,
as in King James's version, but a he-goat, which, with
the exception of the case of a sin of commission as
described in chap. iv. 13, 14, appears to have been the
usual victim. For the selection of such a victim, no
reason appears more probable than that assigned by
rabbinical tradition, namely, that it was intended to
counteract the tendency of the people to the worship of
shaggy he-goats, referred to in chap. xvii. 7, "They
shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices unto the he-goats
(R.V.), after whom they go a whoring."</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Order of the Offerings.</span></p>

<p class="center">ix. 7-21.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And Moses said unto Aaron, Draw near unto the altar, and offer
thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make atonement for
thyself, and for the people: and offer the oblation of the people, and
make atonement for them; as the Lord commanded. So Aaron drew
near unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which was
for himself. And the sons of Aaron presented the blood unto him:
and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of
the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar: but the
fat, and the kidneys, and the caul from the liver of the sin offering, he
burnt upon the altar; as the Lord commanded Moses. And the flesh
and the skin he burnt with fire without the camp. And he slew the
burnt offering; and Aaron's sons delivered unto him the blood, and
he sprinkled it upon the altar round about. And they delivered the
burnt offering unto him, piece by piece, and the head: and he burnt
them upon the altar. And he washed the inwards and the legs,
and burnt them upon the burnt offering on the altar. And he
presented the people's oblation, and took the goat of the sin offering
which was for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as
the first. And he presented the burnt offering, and offered it according
to the ordinance. And he presented the meal offering, and
filled his hand therefrom, and burnt it upon the altar, besides the
burnt offering of the morning. He slew also the ox and the ram,
the sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people: and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Aaron's sons delivered unto him the blood, and he sprinkled it upon
the altar round about, and the fat of the ox; and of the ram, the fat
tail, and that which covered the inwards, and the kidneys, and the
caul of the liver: and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt
the fat upon the altar: and the breast and the right thigh Aaron
waved for a wave offering before the Lord; as Moses commanded."</p></blockquote>

<p>Verses 7-21 detail the way in which this commandment
of Moses was carried out in the offerings, first,
for Aaron and his sons, and then for all the people;
but, as the peculiarities of these several offerings have
been already explained, they need not here detain us.
That which is new, and of profound spiritual and
typical meaning, is the <em>order</em> of the sacrifices as here
enjoined; an order, which as we learn from many
Scriptures, represented what was intended to be the
permanent and invariable law. The appointed order of
the offerings was as follows: first, whenever presented,
came the sin-offering, as here; then, the burnt-offering,
with its meal-offering; and last, always, the peace-offering,
with its characteristic sacrificial feast.</p>

<p>The significance of this order will readily appear if
we consider the distinctive meaning of each of these
offerings. The sin-offering had for its central thought,
expiation of sin by the shedding of blood; the burnt-offering,
the full surrender of the person symbolised by
the victim, to God; the meal-offering, in like manner,
the consecration of the fruit of his labours; the peace-offering,
sustenance of life from God's table, and fellowship
in peace and joy with God and with one another.
And the great lesson for us now from this model
tabernacle service is this: that this order is determined
by a law of the spiritual life.</p>

<p>So much as this, even without clear prevision of the
Antitype of all these sacrifices, the thoughtful Israelite
might have discerned; and even though the truth thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
symbolised is placed before us no more in rite and
symbol, yet it abides, and ever will abide, a truth. Man
everywhere needs fellowship with God, and cannot rest
without it; to attain such fellowship is the object of all
religions which recognise the being of a God at all.
Even among the heathen, we are truly told, there are
many who are feeling after God "if haply they may find
Him;" and, among ourselves in Christian lands, and
even in the external fellowship of Christian churches,
there are many who with aching hearts are seeking
after an unrealised experience of peace and fellowship
with God. And yet God is "not far from any one of
us;" and the whole Scripture represents Him as longing
on His part with an incomprehensible condescension
and love after fellowship with us, desiring to
communicate to us His fulness; and still so many seek
and find not!</p>

<p>We need not go further than this order of the offerings,
and the spiritual truth it signifies regarding the
order of grace, to discover the secret of these spiritual
failures.</p>

<p>The peace-offering, the sacrificial feast of fellowship
with God, the joyful banqueting on the food of His
table, was always, as on this day, in order. Before
this must ever come the burnt-offering. The ritual
prescribed that the peace-offering should be burnt
"upon the burnt-offering;" the presence of the burnt-offering
is thus presupposed in every acceptable peace-offering.
But what if one had ventured to ignore this
divinely-appointed order, and had offered his peace-offering
to be burnt alone; can we imagine that it
would have been accepted?</p>

<p>These things are a parable, and not a hard one. For
the burnt-offering with its meal-offering symbolised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
full consecration of the person and the works to the
Lord. Remembering this, we see that the order is not
arbitrary. For, in the nature of the case, full consecration
to God must precede fellowship with God; he who
would know what it is to have God give Himself to
him, must first be ready to give himself to God. And
that God should enter into loving fellowship with any
one who is holding back from loving self-surrender is
not to be expected. This is not merely an Old Testament
law, still less merely a fanciful deduction from
the Mosaic symbolism; everywhere in the New Testament
is the thought pressed upon us, no longer indeed
in symbol, but in plainest language. It is taught by
precept in some of the most familiar words of the great
Teacher. There is promise, for example, of constant
supply of sufficient food and raiment, fellowship with
God in temporal things; but only on condition that
"we seek first the kingdom of God, and His righteousness,"
shall "all these things be added unto us" (Matt.
vi. 33). There is a promise of "a hundred-fold in this
life, and in the world to come, eternal life;" but it is
prefaced by the condition of surrender of father, mother,
brethren, sisters, of houses and lands, for the Lord's
sake (Matt. xix. 29). Not, indeed, that the actual
parting with these is enjoined in every case; but, certainly,
it is intended that we shall hold all at the Lord's
disposal, possessing, but "as though we possessed
not;"&mdash;this is the least that we can take out of these
words.</p>

<p>Full consecration of the person and the works, this
then is the condition of fellowship with God; and if
so many lament the lack of the latter, it is no doubt
because of the lack of the former. We often act
strangely in this matter; half unconsciously, searching,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
perhaps, every corner of our life but the right one, from
looking into which by the clear light of God's Word
we instinctively shrink, conscience softly whispering
that just there is something about which we have a
lurking doubt, and which therefore, if we will be fully
consecrated, we must at once give up, till we are sure
that it is right, and right for us; and for that self-denial,
that renunciation unto God, we are not ready. Is it
a wonder that, if such be our experience, we lack that
blessed, joyful fellowship with the Lord, of which some
tell us? Is it not rather the chief wonder that we
should wonder at the lack, when yet we are not ready
to consecrate all, body, soul, and spirit, with all our
works, unto the Lord? Let us then remember the law
of the offerings upon this point. No Israelite could
have the blessed feast of the peace-offering, except, first,
the burnt-offering and the meal-offering, symbolising
full consecration, were smoking on the altar.</p>

<p>But this full consecration seems to many so exceeding
hard,&mdash;nay, we may say more, to many it is utterly
impossible. A consecration of some things, especially
those for which they care little, this they can hear of;
but a consecration of <em>all</em>, that the whole may be consumed
upon the altar before and unto God, this they
cannot think of. Which means&mdash;can we escape the
conclusion?&mdash;that the love of God does not yet rule
supreme. How sad! and how strange! But the law
of the offerings will again declare the secret of the
strange holding back from full consecration. For it
was ordained, that wherever there was sin in the
offerer, unconfessed and unforgiven, before even the
burnt-offering must go the sin-offering, expiating sin
by blood presented on the altar before God. And here
we come upon another law of the spiritual life in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
ages. If fellowship with God in peace and joy is conditioned
by the full consecration of person and service
to Him, this consecration, even as a possibility for us,
is in turn conditioned by the expiation of sin through
the great Sin-offering. So long as conscience is not
satisfied that the question of sin has been settled in
grace and righteousness with God, so long it is a spiritual
impossibility that the soul should come into that
experience of the love of God, manifested through
atonement, which alone can lead to full consecration.</p>

<p>This truth is always of vital importance; but it is, if
possible, more important than ever to insist upon it in
our day, when, more and more, the doctrine of the expiation
of sin through the blood of the Lamb of God is
denied, and that, forsooth, under the claim of superior
enlightenment. Men are well pleased to hear of a
burnt-offering, so long especially as it is made to signify
no more than the self-devotement of the offerer; but for
a sin-offering, much modern theology has no place. So
soon as we begin to speak of the sacrifice of our Lord
for sin in the dialect of the ancient altar&mdash;which, it
must never be forgotten, is that of Christ and His
apostles&mdash;we are told that "it would be better for the
world if the Christian doctrine of sacrifice could be
presented to men apart from the old Jewish ideas and
terms, which only serve to obscure the simplicity that
is in Christ(!)" And so men, under the pretext of
magnifying the love of God, and laying a truer basis
for spiritual life, in effect deny the supreme and incomparable
manifestation of that love, that God made
"Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf"
(2 Cor. v. 21).</p>

<p>Very different is the teaching, not merely of the law
of Moses, but of the whole New Testament; which, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
all it has to say of the Christian life as proceeding from
full self-surrender, ever represents this full consecration
as inspired by the believing recognition and penitent
acceptance of Christ, not merely as the great Example
of perfect consecration, but as a sin-offering, reconciling
us first of all by His death, before He saves us by His
life (Rom. v. 10). The expiation of sin by the sin-offering,
before the consecration which burnt-offering
and meal-offering typify,&mdash;this is the invariable order
in both Testaments. The Apostle Paul, in his account
of his own full consecration, is in full accord with the
spiritual teaching of the Mosaic ritual when he gives
this as the order. He describes himself, and that in
terms of no undue exaggeration, as so under the constraint
of the love of Christ as to seem to some beside
himself; and then he goes on to explain the secret of
this consecration, in which he had placed himself and
all he had upon God's altar, as a whole burnt-sacrifice,
as consisting just in this, that he had first apprehended
the mystery of Christ's death, as a substitution so true
and real of the sinless Victim in the place of sinful
men, that it might be said that "one died for all,
therefore all died;" whence he thus judged, "that they
which live should no longer live unto themselves, but
unto Him who for their sakes died and rose again"
(2 Cor. v. 13-15). To the same effect is the teaching
of the Apostle John. For all true consecration springs
from the thankful recognition of the love of God; and,
according to this Apostle also, the Divine love which
inspires the consecration is manifest in this, that "He
sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins"
(1 John iv. 10). The apprehension, then, of the reality
of the expiation made by the great Sin-offering, and the
believing appropriation of its virtue to the cancelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
of our guilt, this is the inseparable previous condition
of full consecration of person and work unto the Lord.
It is so, because only the apprehension of the need
of expiation by the blood of the Son of God, as the
necessary condition of forgiveness, can give us any
adequate measure of the depth of our guilt and ruin,
as God sees it; and, on the other hand, only when
we remember that God spared not His only-begotten
Son, but sent Him to become, through death upon
the cross, a propitiation for our sins, can we begin
to have such an estimate of the love of God and of
Christ His Son as shall make full consecration easy,
or even possible.</p>

<p>Let us then, on no account, miss this lesson from the
order of this ritual; before the peace-offering, the burnt-offering;
before the burnt-offering, the sin-offering. Or,
translating the symbolism, perfect fellowship with God
in peace and joy and life, only after consecration; and
the consecration only possible in fulness, and only
accepted of God, in any case, when the great Sin-offering
has been first believingly appropriated, according
to God's ordination, as the propitiation for our sins,
for the cancelling of our guilt.</p>

<p>But there is yet more in this order of the offerings.
For, as the New Testament in every way teaches us,
the Antitype of every offering was Christ. As we have
already seen, in the Sin-offering we have the type of
Christ as our propitiation, or expiation; in the burnt-offering,
of Christ as consecrating Himself unto God in
our behalf; in the meal-offering, as, in like manner,
consecrating all His works in our behalf; in the peace-offering,
as imparting Himself to us as our life, and
thus bringing us into fellowship of peace and love and
joy with the Father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>Now this last is, in fact, the ultimate aim of salvation;
rather, indeed, we may say, it is salvation. For life
in its fulness means the cancelling of death; death
spiritual, and bodily death also, in resurrection from
the dead; it means also perfect fellowship with the
living God, and this, attained, is heaven. Hence it
must needs be that the peace-offering which represents
Christ as giving Himself to us as our life, and introducing
us into this blessed state, comes last.</p>

<p>But before this, in order, not of time, but of grace,
as also of logic, must be Christ as Sin-offering, and
Christ as Burnt-offering. And, first of all, Christ as
Sin-offering. For God's way of peace puts the cancelling
of guilt, the satisfaction of His holy law and justice,
and therewith the restoration of our right relation to
Him, first, and in order to a holy life and fellowship;
while man will ever put these last, and regard the
latter as the means to obtaining a right standing with
God. Hence, inasmuch as Christ, coming to save us,
finds us under a curse, the first thing in order is, and
must be, the removal of that curse of the holy wrath
of God, against every one that "continueth not in all
things that are written in the book of the law, to do
them." And so, first in order in the typical ritual is
the sin-offering which represents Christ as made "a
curse for us," that He might thus redeem us from
the curse of the law (Gal. iii. 13).</p>

<p>But this is not a complete account of the work of our
Lord for us in the days of His flesh. His work indeed
was one, but the Scriptures set it forth in a twofold
aspect. On the one hand, He is the Sinless One bearing
the curse for us; but also, in all His suffering for our
sins, He is also manifested as the Righteous One, making
many righteous by His obedience, even an obedience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
unto the death of the cross (Rom. v. 19; Phil. ii. 8).
And if we ask what was the essence of this obedience
of our Lord for us, what was it, indeed, but that which
is the essence of all obedience to God, namely, full, unreserved,
uninterrupted consecration and self-surrender
to the will of the Father? And as, by His suffering,
Christ endured the curse for us, so by all His obedience
and suffering in full submission to the will of God, He
became also "the Lord our righteousness." And this,
as repeatedly remarked, is the central thought of the
burnt-offering and the meal-offering,&mdash;full consecration
of the person and the work to God.</p>

<p>In the sin-offering, then, we see Christ as our
propitiation; in the burnt-offering, we see Him rather
as our righteousness; but the former is presupposed
in the latter; and apart from this, that in His death He
became the expiation of our sins, His obedience could
have availed us nothing. But given now Christ as
our propitiation and also our righteousness, the whole
question of the relation of Christ's people to God in
law and righteousness is settled, and the way is now
clear for the communication of life which the peace-offering
symbolised. Thus, as by faith in Christ as the
Sin-offering, our propitiation and righteousness, we are
"justified freely by grace," "apart from the works of the
law," so now the way is open, by the appropriation
of Christ as our life in the peace-offering, for our
sanctification and complete redemption. In a word, the
law of the order of the offerings teaches, symbolically
and typically, exactly what, in Rom. vi. and vii., the
Apostle Paul teaches dogmatically, namely, that the
order of grace is first justification, then sanctification;
but both by the same crucified Christ, our propitiation,
our righteousness, and our life: in whom we come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
have fellowship in all good and blessing with the
Father.</p>

<p>It is interesting to observe that after the analogy of
this order of the offerings, is the most usual order of the
development of Christian experience. For the awakened
soul is usually first of all concerned about the question
of forgiveness of sin and acceptance; and hence, most
commonly, faith first apprehends Christ in this aspect,
as the One who "bare our sins in His body," by whose
stripes we are healed; and then, at a later period
of experience, as the One who also, in lowly consecration
to the Father's will, obeyed for us, that we
might be made righteous through His obedience. But
no one who is truly justified by faith in Christ as
our propitiation and righteousness, can long rest with
this. He very quickly finds what he had little thought
of before, that the evil nature abides even in the
justified and accepted believer; nay, more, that it has
still a terrible strength to overcome him and lead him
into sin, even often when he would not. And this
prepares the believer, still in accord with the law of
the order of grace here set forth, to lay hold also on
Christ by faith as His Peace-offering, by feeding on
whom we receive spiritual strength, so that He thus,
in a word, becomes our sanctification and, at last, full
redemption.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Double Benediction.</span></p>

<p class="center">ix. 22-24.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed
them; and he came down from offering the sin offering, and the
burnt offering, and the peace offerings. And Moses and Aaron went
into the tent of meeting, and came out, and blessed the people: and
the glory of the Lord appeared unto all the people. And there came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
forth fire from before the Lord, and consumed upon the altar the
burnt offering and the fat: and when all the people saw it, they
shouted, and fell on their faces."</p></blockquote>

<p>The sacrifices having now been made, and the
offerings presented in this divinely-appointed order, by
the ordained and consecrated priesthood, two things
followed: a double benediction was pronounced upon
the people, and Jehovah manifested to them His glory.
We read (ver. 22), "And Aaron lifted up his hands
toward the people, and blessed them; and he came
down from offering the sin offering, and the burnt
offering, and the peace offerings."</p>

<p>Presumably, the form of benediction which Aaron
used was that which, according to Numb. vi. 24-27, the
priests were commanded by the Lord to use: "The
Lord bless thee, and keep thee: the Lord make His
face to shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee:
the Lord lift up His countenance upon thee, and
give thee peace." It was not an empty form; for the
Lord at that time also promised Himself to make this
blessing efficient, saying thereafter, "So shall they put
My Name"&mdash;Jehovah, the name of God in covenant,&mdash;"upon
the children of Israel; and I will bless them."</p>

<p>So also the Lord Jesus, just before withdrawing from
the bodily sight of His disciples after the completion
of His great sacrifice, "lifted up His hands, and blessed
them;" and thereupon disappeared from their sight,
ascending into heaven. Even so was it in the typical
service of this day; for when Aaron had thus lifted
up his hands and blessed the people (ver. 23), "Moses
and Aaron went into the tent of meeting."</p>

<p>The work of Aaron in the outer court had been
finished, and now he disappears from Israel's sight; for
he must, in like manner, be inducted into the priestly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
work within the Holy Place. He must there be shown
all those things to which, in his priestly ministrations,
the blood must be applied; and, especially, must also
offer the sweet incense at the golden altar which was
before the veil which enshrined the immediate presence
of Jehovah. But this offering of incense, as all have
agreed, typifies the precious and most effective intercession
of the great Antitype; so that thus it was shown
in a figure, how the Christ of God, having finished His
sacrificial work in the sight of men, and having ascended
into heaven, should there for a season abide, hidden
from human sight, making intercession for His waiting
people.</p>

<p>After an interval&mdash;we are not told how long&mdash;Moses
and Aaron again (vv. 23, 24), "came out, and blessed the
people: and the glory of the Lord appeared unto all the
people. And there came forth fire from before the Lord,
and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the
fat: and when all the people saw it, they shouted, and
fell on their faces."</p>

<p>This second blessing by Moses and Aaron conjointly,
followed Aaron's reappearance to Israel, and marked
the completion of these inauguration services, the intercession
within the veil, as well as the sacrifices. And
the revelation in a visible way of the glory of the Lord
added what now was alone required, the manifest attestation
by the Lord of the tabernacle of His approval of
all that had been done in these memorable eight days.
This appearance of the Shekinah glory was followed by
a flash of fire which, in token of the Divine appropriation
of the sacrifices, consumed in an instant the burnt-offering
on the altar with the fat of the sin-offering and
the peace-offering, which had been laid upon it. We
cannot follow here the Jewish tradition, which has it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
that with this act the sacrificial fire which was never
to go out upon the altar, was originated. On the contrary,
as we have seen, the offerings had before this
been made by Moses, and even on this day the fire had
been kindled before (ver. 10, <em>et seq.</em>). Nor is there
any necessary inconsistency here; for we have but to
suppose that the burning of the sacrifices which had
been kindled by Aaron was not yet complete, when the
flash from the cloud of glory in an instant consummated
the burning, teaching in a most august and impressive
manner the symbolic meaning of the burning of the
sacrifices on the altar, as signifying the acceptance and
appropriation of that which was offered, by the Lord
who had commanded all, and thereby endorsing all
that had been done, as according to His mind and will.</p>

<p>And even so, according to the sure Word of prophecy,
our heavenly High Priest has yet in reserve for His
people a second benediction. His first blessing upon
leaving the world was followed by Pentecost; the
second, on His reappearing, shall bring in resurrection
and full salvation. And in that day, when He "shall
appear a second time, apart from sin, to them that
wait for Him unto salvation" (Heb. ix. 28), therewith
shall appear the glory which on that day, long ago,
appeared to Israel; for He "shall come in the glory
of His Father," and thus shall God, the Most High and
the Most Holy, testify before the universe His gracious
acceptance of the service of the true Aaron and His
"many sons," the priestly people of God, through all
the Christian ages. Thus, the services and events of
that day of induction, in their order from beginning to
end, were not only a parable of the order of grace, but
also, as it were, a typical epitome of the whole work of
redemption. They are thus a prophecy that the work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
which began when Christ made His soul an offering
for sin, and to perfect which He is now withdrawn
from our sight for a season, shall be consummated at
last by His reappearing in glory for the final blessing
of His waiting people.</p>

<p>And if we look at other and subordinate aspects of
this inauguration service, we shall still find this sequel
of all, no less richly suggestive. Expiation, righteousness,
fellowship in peace with God, shall bring with it
the blessing of the Lord, and finally issue in the revelation
of His glory in the sight of all who accept this
great redemption through sacrifice. And so also in the
personal life. As the trustful acceptance and use of
the appointed Sin-offering leads to the consecration of
the person and the life, and as by this consecration we
come into conscious fellowship with God in joy and
peace, as we feed on the flesh of the slain Lamb, so,
as the blessed result, unto every true believer, according
to the measure of his faith, this is followed by the
double benediction of the Lord; one for this life, and
a larger, for the life which is to come. The Lord
blesses him, and keeps him: the Lord makes His face to
shine upon him, and is gracious unto him: the Lord
lifts up His countenance upon him, and gives him
peace, according to that word of the great High Priest:
"Peace I leave with you; My peace I give unto you"
(John xiv. 27). And then, after the present peace, is
yet to follow, as the final issue of the expiated sin, and
the consecrated life, and fellowship in peace with the
God of life and love, the beholding of the glory of the
Lord; according to that high-priestly prayer of our
Redeemer, "That which Thou hast given Me, I will
that, where I am, they also may be with Me: that they
may behold My glory" (John xvii. 24). Even here some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
know a little of this, and find that expiated sin and
full consecration are followed here and now by bright
glimpses of the glory of the Lord. But what is now
seen thus in part shall then be seen fully and face to
face. Who would not make sure of that beatific vision
of the glory of the Lord?</p>

<h3><em>NADAB'S AND ABIHU'S "STRANGE FIRE."</em></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lev.</span> x. 1-20.</p>


<p>The solemn and august ceremonies of the consecration
of the priests and the tabernacle, and the
inauguration of the tabernacle service, had a sad and
terrible termination. The sacrifices of the inauguration
day had been completed, the congregation had received
the priestly benediction, the glory of Jehovah had appeared
unto the people, and, in token of His acceptance
of all that had been done, consumed the victims on
the altar. This manifestation of the glory of the Lord
so affected the people&mdash;as well it might&mdash;that when
they saw it, "they shouted, and fell on their faces."
It was, probably, under the influence of the excitement
of this occasion that (vv. 1, 2), "Nadab and Abihu,
the sons of Aaron, took each of them his censer, and
put fire therein, and laid incense thereon, and offered
strange fire before the Lord, which He had not commanded
them. And there came forth fire from before
the Lord, and devoured them, and they died before the
Lord."</p>

<p>There has been no little speculation as to what it was,
precisely, which they did. Some will have it, that they
lighted their incense, not from the altar fire, but elsewhere.
As to this, while it is not easy to prove that to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
light the incense at the altar fire was an invariable
requirement, yet it is certain that this was commanded
for the great day of atonement (xvi. 12); and also, that
when Moses offered incense in connection with the
plague which broke out upon the rebellion of Korah,
Dathan, and Abiram, Moses commanded him to take
the fire for the censer from off the altar (Numb. xvi. 46);
so that, perhaps this is not unlikely to have been one
element, at least, in their offence. Others, again, have
thought that their sin lay in this, that they offered their
incense at a time not commanded in the order of worship
which God had just prescribed; and this, too, may very
probably have been another element in their sin, for it
is certain that the divinely-appointed order of worship
for the day had been already completed. Yet again,
others have supposed that they rashly and without
Divine warrant pressed within the veil, into the immediate
presence of the Shekinah glory of God, to offer
their incense there. For this, too, there is evidence, in
the fact that the institution of the great annual day of
atonement, and the prohibition of entrance within the
veil at any other time, even to the high priest himself,
is said to have followed "after the death of the two
sons of Aaron, when they drew near before the Lord,
and died" (xvi. 1, 2).</p>

<p>It is perfectly possible, and even likely, that all these
elements were combined in their offence. In any case,
the gravamen of their sin is expressed in these words;
they offered "fire which the Lord had not commanded
them:" offered it, either in a way not commanded, or
at a time not commanded, or in a place not commanded;
or, perhaps, in each and all of these ways, offered "fire
which the Lord had not commanded." This was their
sin, and one which brought instant and terrible judgment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>It is easy enough to believe that yet they meant well
in what they did. It probably seemed to them the right
thing to do. After such a stupendous display as they
had just witnessed, of the flaming glory of Jehovah, why
should they not, in token of reverence and adoration,
offer incense, even in the most immediate presence of
Jehovah? And why should such minor variations from
the appointed law, as to manner, or time, or place,
matter very much, so the motive was worship? So may
they probably have reasoned, if indeed they thought
at all. But, nevertheless, this made no difference; all
the same, "fire came forth from Jehovah, and devoured
them." They had been but so lately consecrated! and&mdash;as
we learn from ver. 5&mdash;their priestly robes were
on them at the time, in token of their peculiar privilege
of special nearness to God! But this, too, made no
difference; "there came forth fire from before the Lord
and devoured them."</p>

<p>Their sin, in the form in which it was committed,
can never be repeated; but as regards its inner nature
and essence, no sin has been in all ages more common.
For the essence of their sin was this, that it was will-worship;
worship in which they consulted not the
revealed will of God regarding the way in which He
would be served, but their own fancies and inclinations.
The directions for worship had been, as we have seen,
exceedingly full and explicit; but they apparently
imagined that the fragrance of their incense, and its
intrinsic suitableness as a symbol of adoration and
prayer, was sufficient to excuse neglect of strict obedience
to the revealed will of God touching His own worship.
Their sin was not unlike that of Saul in a later day,
who thought to excuse disobedience by the offering
of enormous sacrifices. But he was sharply reminded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
that "to obey is better than sacrifice" (1 Sam. xv.
22); and the priesthood were in like manner on this
occasion very terribly taught that obedience is also
better than incense, even the incense of the sanctuary.</p>

<p>In all ages, men have been prone to commit this sin,
and in ours as much as any. It is true that in the
present dispensation the Lord has left more in His
worship than in earlier days to the sanctified judgment
of His people, and has not minutely prescribed
details for our direction. It is true, again, that there
is, and always will be, room for some difference of
judgment among good and loyal servants of the Lord,
as to how far the liberty left us extends. But we are
certainly all taught as much as this, that wherever we
are not clear that we have a Divine warrant for what
we do in the worship of God, we need to be exceeding
careful, and to act with holy fear, lest possibly, like
Nadab and Abihu, we be chargeable with offering
"strange fire," which the Lord has not commanded. And
when one goes into many a church and chapel, and
sees the multitude of remarkable devices by which,
as is imagined, the worship and adoration of God is
furthered, it must be confessed that it certainly seems
as if the generation of Nadab and Abihu was not yet
extinct; even although a patient God, in the mystery
of His long-suffering, flashes not instantly forth His
vengeance.</p>

<p>This then is the first lesson of this tragic occurrence.
We have to do with a God who is very jealous; who
will be worshipped as He wills, or not at all. Nor can
we complain. If God be such a Being as we are
taught in the Holy Scripture, it must be His inalienable
right to determine and prescribe how He will be
served.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>And it is a second lesson, scarcely less evident, that
with God, intention of good, though it palliate, cannot
excuse disobedience where He has once made known
His will. No one can imagine that Nadab and Abihu
meant wrong; but for all that, for their sin they died.</p>

<p>Again, we are herein impressively taught that, with
God, high position confers no immunity when a man
sins; least of all, high position in the Church. On the
contrary, the greater the exaltation in spiritual honour
and privilege, the more strictly will a man be held to
account for every failure to honour Him who exalted
him. We have seen this illustrated already by the law
of the sin-offering; and this tragic story illustrates the
same truth again.</p>

<p>But the question naturally arises, How could these
men, who had been so exalted in privilege, who had
even beheld the glory of the God of Israel in the holy
mount (Exod. xxiv. 1, 9, 10), have ventured upon such
a perilous experiment? The answer is probably suggested
by the warning which immediately followed their
death (vv. 8, 9): "The Lord spake unto Aaron, saying,
Drink no wine nor strong drink, ... when ye go
into the tent of the meeting, that ye die not." It is
certainly distinctly hinted by these words, that it was
under the excitement of strong drink that these men so
fatally sinned.</p>

<p>If so, then, although their sin may not be repeated
in its exact form among us, yet the fact points a very
solemn warning, not only regarding the careless use of
strong drink, but, more than that, against all religious
worship and activity which is inspired by other stimulus
than by the Holy Spirit of God. Of this every age
of the Church's history has furnished sad examples.
Sometimes we see it illustrated in "revivals," even in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
such as may be marked by some evidence of the presence
of the Spirit of God; when injudicious speakers seek
by various methods to work up what is, after all,
merely a physical excitement of a strange, infectious
kind, though too often mistaken for the work of the
Holy Spirit of God. More subtle and yet more common
is the sin of such as in preaching the Word find their
chief stimulation in the excitement of a crowded house,
or the visible signs of approbation on the part of the
hearers; and perhaps sometimes mistake the natural
effect of this influence for the quickening power of
the Holy Ghost, and go on to offer before the Lord the
incense of their religious service and worship, but with
"strange fire." Of this all need to beware; and most
of all, ministers of the Word.</p>

<p>The penalty of sin is often long delayed, but it did
not lag in this case. The strange fire in the hands of
Nadab and Abihu was met by a flash of flame that instantly
withered their life; and, just as they were, their
priestly robes upon them unconsumed, their censers
in their hands, they dropped dead before the fatal
bolt.</p>

<p>In reading this account and other similar narratives
in Holy Scripture, of the deadly outbreak of God's
wrath, many have felt not a little disquieted in mind
because of the terrific severity of the judgment, which
to them seems so out of all proportion to the guilt of
the offender. And so, in many hearts, and even to
many lips, the question has perforce arisen: Is it
possible to believe that in this passage, for instance, we
have a true representation of the character of God?
In answering such a question we ought always to
remember, first of all, that, apart from our imperfect
knowledge, just because we all are sinners, we are, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
that fact, all more or less disqualified and incapacitated
for forming a correct and unbiassed judgment regarding
the demerit of sin. It is quite certain that every sinful
man is naturally inclined to take a lenient view of the
guilt of sin, and, by necessary consequence, of its
desert in respect of punishment. In approaching this
question, here and elsewhere in God's Word, it is imperative
that we keep this fact in mind.</p>

<p>Again, it is not unnecessary to remark, that we
must be careful and not read into this narrative what,
in fact, is not here. For it is often assumed without
evidence, that when we read in the Bible of men
being suddenly cut off by death for some special sin,
we are therefore required to believe that the temporal
judgment of physical death must have been followed,
in each instance, by the judgment of the eternal
fire. But always to infer this in such cases, when, as
here, nothing of the kind is hinted in the text, is a
great mistake, and introduces a difficulty which is
wholly of our own making. That sometimes, at least,
the facts are quite the opposite, is expressly certified to
us in 1 Cor. xi. 30-32, where we are told that among
the Christians of Corinth, many, because of their
irreverent approach to the Holy Supper of the Lord,
slept the sleep of death; but that these judgments
from the Lord, of bodily death, instead of being necessarily
intended for their eternal destruction, were sent
that they might not finally perish. For the Apostle's
words are most explicit; for it is with reference to
these cases of sickness and death of which he had
spoken, that he adds (ver. 32): "But when we are
(thus) judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we
may not be condemned with the world."</p>

<p>What we have here before us, then, is not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
question of the eternal condemnation of Nadab and
Abihu for their thoughtless, though perhaps not so
intended, profanation of God's worship,&mdash;a point on
which the narrative gives us no information,&mdash;but,
simply and only, the inflicting on them, for this sin,
of the judgment of temporal death. And if this yet
seem to some undue severity, as no doubt it will, there
remain other considerations which deserve to have
great weight here. In the first place, if this reveal
God as terribly severe in His judgment, even upon what,
compared with other crimes, may seem a small sin, we
have to remember that, after all, this God of the Bible,
this Jehovah of the Old Testament, is only herein
revealed as in this respect like the God whose working
we see in nature and in history. Was the God of
Nadab and Abihu a severe God? Is not the God of
nature a terribly severe God? Who then is it that
has so appointed the economy of nature that even for
one thoughtless indulgence by a young man, he shall
be racked with pain all his life thereafter? It is a law
of nature, one says. But what is a law of nature but
the ordinary operation of the Divine Being who made
nature? So let us not forget that the reasoning which,
because of the confessed severity of this judgment on
the sons of Aaron, argues God out of the tenth of
Leviticus, and refuses to believe that this can be a
revelation of His mind and character, by parity of reasoning
must go on to argue God out of nature and out of
history. But if one be not yet ready for the latter, let
him take heed how he too hastily decide on this ground
against the verity of the history and the truth of the
revelation in the case before us.</p>

<p>Then, again, we need to be careful that we pass not
judgment before considering all that was involved in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
this act of sin. We cannot look upon the case as if
the act of Nadab and Abihu had been merely a private
matter, personal to themselves alone. This it was not,
and could not be. They did what they did in their
official robes; moreover, it was a peculiarly public act:
it took place before the sanctuary, where all the people
were assembled. What was the influence of this their
act, if it passed unrebuked and unpunished, likely to
be? History shows that nothing was more inbred in
the nature of the people than just this tendency to
will-worship. For centuries after this, notwithstanding
many like terrible judgments, it mightily prevailed,
taking the form of numberless attempted improvements
on the arrangements of worship appointed by God,
and introducing, under such pretexts of expediency
often the grossest idolatry. And although the Babylonian
judgment made an end of the idolatrous form of
will-worship, the old tendency persisted, and worked on
under a new form till, as we learn from our Lord's
words in the Gospel, the people were in His day
utterly overwhelmed with "heavy burdens and grievous
to be borne," rabbinical additions to the law, attempted
improvements on Moses, under pretext of honouring
Moses, all begotten of this same inveterate spirit of
will-worship. Nor are such things of little consequence,
as some seem to imagine, whether we find them
among Jews or in Christian communions. On the
contrary, all will-worship, in all its endless variety of
forms, tends to confuse conscience, by confounding
with the commandments of God the practices and
traditions of men; and all history, no less of the
Church than of Israel, shows that the tendency of all
such will-worship is to the subversion alike of morality
religion, occasioning, too often, total misapprehension<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
as to what indeed is the essence of religion well
pleasing to God.</p>

<p>Was the sin of the priests, Nadab and Abihu, then,
committed in such a public manner, such a trifling
matter after all? And when we further remember the
peculiar circumstances of the occasion,&mdash;that the whole
ceremonial of the day was designed in a special manner
to instruct the people as to the manner in which
Jehovah, their King and their God, would be worshipped,&mdash;it
certainly is not so hard, after all, to see
how it was almost imperative that in the very beginning
of Israel's national history, God should give them a
lesson on the sanctity of His ordinances and His hatred
of will-worship, which should be remembered to all
time.</p>

<p>The solemn lesson of the terrible judgment, Moses,
as Prophet and Interpreter of God's will to the people,
declares in these words (ver. 3): "This is it that the
Lord spake, saying, I will be sanctified in them that
come nigh Me, and before all the people I will be
glorified."</p>

<p>If God separate a people to be specially near unto
Him, it is that, admitted to such special nearness to
Himself, they shall ever reverently recognise His transcendent
exaltation in holiness, and take care that He
be ever glorified in them before all men. But if any be
careless of this, God will nevertheless not be defrauded.
If they will recognise His august holiness, in the
reverence of loyal service, well; God shall thus glorify
Himself in them before all. But if otherwise, still God
will be glorified in them before all people, though now
in their chastisement and in retribution. The principle
is that which is announced by Amos (iii. 2): "You only
have I known of all the families of the earth; <em>therefore</em> I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
will visit upon you all your iniquities." And when we
remember that the sons of Aaron typically represent
the whole body of believers in Christ, as a priestly
people, it is plain that the warning of this judgment
comes directly home to us all. If, as Christians, we
have been brought into a relation of special nearness
and privilege with God, we have to remember that the
place of privilege is, in this case, a place of peculiar
danger. If we forget the reverence and honour due
to His name, and insist on will-worship of any kind,
we shall in some way suffer for it. God may wink at
the sins of others, but not at ours. He is a God of
love, and desires not our death, but that He may be
glorified in our life; but if any will not have it so, He
will not be robbed of His glory. Hence the warning
of the Apostle Peter, who was so filled with these Old
Testament conceptions of God and His worship: "It
is written, Ye shall be holy, for I am holy. And if ye
call on Him as Father, who without respect of persons
judgeth according to each man's work, pass the time
of your sojourning in fear" (1 Peter i. 17).</p>

<p>Ver. 3: "And Aaron held his peace."</p>

<p>For rebellion were useless; nay, it had been madness.
Even the tenderest natural affection must be
silent when God smites for sin; and in this case the
sin was so manifest, and the connection therewith of
the judgment so evident, that Aaron could say nothing,
though his heart must have been breaking.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mourning in Silence.</span></p>

<p class="center">x. 4-7.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the
uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Draw near, carry your brethren
from before the sanctuary out of the camp. So they drew near,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
and carried them in their coats out of the camp; as Moses had
said. And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto
Ithamar, his sons, Let not the hair of your heads go loose, neither
rend your clothes; that ye die not, and that He be not wroth with
all the congregation: but let your brethren, the whole house of
Israel, bewail the burning which the Lord hath kindled. And ye
shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting, lest ye die: for
the anointing oil of the Lord is upon you. And they did according
to the word of Moses."</p></blockquote>

<p>Even in ordinary cases, restrictions were placed upon
Aaron and his sons as regards the outward signs of
mourning; but exceptions were made in the case of
the nearest relations, and, in particular, of the death
of a son, or a brother (chap. xxi. 2). In this case,
however, this permission could not be given; and they
are warned that by public expressions of grief they
would not only bring death from the Lord upon themselves,
but also bring His wrath upon the whole congregation
which they represented before God. They
are not indeed forbidden to mourn in their hearts, but
from all the outward and customary signs of mourning
they must abstain. And the reason for this is given;
"The anointing oil of the Lord is upon you." That is,
by the anointing they had been set apart to represent
God before Israel. Hence, when God had thus manifested
His holy wrath against sin, for them to have
exhibited the public signs of mourning for this, even
though the stroke of wrath had fallen into their own
family, would have been a visible contradiction between
their actions and their priestly position. To others,
indeed, these outward tokens of mourning are expressly
permitted, for they stood in no such special relation
to God; their brethren, "the whole house of Israel,"
might bewail the burning which the Lord had kindled,
but they, although nearest of kin to the dead, are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
permitted even to follow the slain of the Lord to the
grave, and (vv. 4, 5) the sad duty is assigned to
their cousins, who bear the dead, in their white priestly
robes, just as they had fallen, out of the camp to burial,
while Aaron and his sons mourn silently within the
tent of meeting.</p>

<p>This has seemed hard to many, and has furnished
some another illustration of the hardness and severity
of the character of God as held up in the Pentateuch.
But we shall do well to remember that in all this we
have nothing which in any respect goes beyond the
very solemn words of the tender-hearted and most
compassionate Saviour, who said, for example, "If
any man cometh unto Me, and hateth not his own
father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren,
and sisters, ... he cannot be My disciple" (Luke
xiv. 26). In language such as this, we cannot but
recognise the same character as in this command unto
Aaron and his sons; and if such "hard sayings" are to
be held reason for rejecting the revelation of the character
of God as given in the Old Testament, the same
logic, in the presence of similar words, will require us
also to reject the revelation of God's character as given
by Christ in the New Testament.</p>

<p>The teaching of both Testaments on this matter is
plain. Natural affection is right; it is indeed implanted
in our hearts by the God who made us in all our human
relations. But none the less, whenever the feelings
which belong even to the nearest and tenderest earthly
relations come into conflict with absolute fealty and
submission to the will of God, and unswerving loyalty
to the will of Christ, then, hard though indeed it may
be, natural affection must give way, and mourn within
the tent in the silence of a holy submission to the Lord.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Carefulness after Judgment.</span></p>

<p class="center">x. 8-20.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And the Lord spake unto Aaron, saying, Drink no wine nor strong
drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tent of
meeting, that ye die not: it shall be a statute for ever throughout
your generations: and that ye may put difference between the holy
and the common, and between the unclean and the clean; and that
ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the Lord
hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses. And Moses spake
unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were
left, Take the meal offering that remaineth of the offerings of the
Lord made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar: for
it is most holy: and ye shall eat it in a holy place, because it is thy
due, and thy sons' due, of the offerings of the Lord made by fire: for
so I am commanded. And the wave breast and the heave thigh shall
ye eat in a clean place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with
thee: for they are given as thy due, and thy sons' due, out of the
sacrifices of the peace offerings of the children of Israel. The heave
thigh and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made
by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering before the Lord: and
it shall be thine, and thy sons' with thee, as a due for ever; as the
Lord hath commanded. And Moses diligently sought the goat of the
sin offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar
and with Ithamar, the sons of Aaron that were left, saying, Wherefore
have ye not eaten the sin offering in the place of the sanctuary,
seeing it is most holy, and He hath given it you to bear the iniquity
of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the Lord?
Behold, the blood of it was not brought into the sanctuary within:
ye should certainly have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded.
And Aaron spake unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered
their sin offering and their burnt offering before the Lord; and there
have befallen me such things as these: and if I had eaten the sin
offering to-day, would it have been well-pleasing in the sight of the
Lord? And when Moses heard that, it was well-pleasing in his sight."</p></blockquote>

<p>Such a judgment as the foregoing ought to have had a
good effect, and it did. This appeared in renewed carefulness
to secure the most exact obedience hereafter in
all their official duties. To this end, the Lord Himself
now laid down a law evidently designed to preclude,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
as far as possible, every risk of any such fault in the
priestly service as might again bring down judgment.
It is not only holiness, but considerate and anxious
love, which speaks in the next words, addressed to
Aaron (vv. 8, 9): "Drink no wine nor strong drink,
thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tent
of meeting, that ye die not: it shall be a statute for ever
throughout your generations."</p>

<p>And for this prohibition the reason is given (vv.
10, 11): "That ye may put difference between the
holy and the common, and between the unclean and
the clean; and that ye may teach the children of Israel
all the statutes which the Lord hath spoken unto them
by the hand of Moses."</p>

<p>It was not then that the use of wine was in itself
sinful; for this is taught nowhere in the Old or New
Testament, and as a doctrine of religion is characteristic,
not of Judaism or Christianity, but only of Mohammedanism,
of Buddhism and other heathen religions.
The ground of this command of abstinence, as of the
New Testament counsel (Rom. xiv. 20, 21), is that of
expediency. Because, in the use of wine or strong drink,
there was involved a certain risk, that by undue indulgence
the judgment might be confused or the memory
weakened, so that something might be done amiss;
therefore the priests, who were specially commissioned
to teach the statutes of the Lord to Israel, and this
most of all, by their own carefulness to obey all the least
of His commandments, are here warned to abstain
whenever about engaging in their official duties. As
suggested above, it is at least very natural to infer,
from the historical setting of this prohibition, that the
fatal offence of Nadab and Abihu was occasioned by
such an indulgence in wine or strong drink as made it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
possible for impulse to get the better of knowledge and
judgment.</p>

<p>But, however this may be, the lesson for us abides
the same; a lesson which each one according to his
circumstances must faithfully apply to his own case.
For the Christian it is not enough that he shall abstain
from what is in its own nature always sinful; it must
be the law of our life that we abstain also from whatever
may needlessly become occasion of sin. In this
we cannot, indeed, lay down a universal code of law.
Heathen reformers have done this, and their imitators
in the Church, but never Christ or His Apostles. And
this with reason. For that which for one carries with
it inevitable risk of sin, is not always fraught with the
same danger to another person with a different temperament,
or even to the same person under different
circumstances. In each instance we must judge for
ourselves, taking heed not to abuse our liberty to
another's harm; and also, on the other hand, being
careful how we judge others in regard to things which
in their essential nature are neither right nor wrong.
But we shall be wise to recognise the fact that it is just
in such things that many Christians do most harm,
both to their own souls and to those of others. And in
regard to the drinking of wine in particular, one must
be blind indeed not to perceive it to be the fact that,
whatever the reason may be, the English-speaking
peoples seem to be peculiarly susceptible to the danger
of undue indulgence in wine and strong drink. On
both sides of the Atlantic, drunkenness must be set
down as one of the most prevalent national sins.</p>

<p>In deciding the question of personal duty in this and
like cases, all believers are bound, as the Lord's priestly
people, to remember that He has appointed them that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
they should walk before Him as a separated people,
who, by their daily walk, above all, are to teach others
to "put a difference between holy and common, and
unclean and clean, and to observe all the statutes which
the Lord hath spoken."</p>

<p>In vv. 12-15 we have a repetition of the commandments
previously given, concerning the use to be made
of the meal-offering and the peace-offering. From this
it appears that Moses himself, in view of the tragic
occurrence of the day, was stirred up to charge Aaron
and his sons anew on matters on which he had already
commanded them. And with this intensified care on
his part is evidently connected the incident recorded
in the verses which follow, where we read that, having
repeated the directions as to the meal-offering and the
peace-offering (vv. 16, 17), "Moses diligently sought
the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burnt;
and he was angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar,
the sons of Aaron that were left, saying, Wherefore
have ye not eaten the sin offering in the place of the
sanctuary, seeing it is most holy, and He hath given it
you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make
atonement for them before the Lord?"</p>

<p>It had indeed been commanded, in the case of those
sin-offerings of which the blood was brought into the
holy place, that their flesh should not be eaten; but
that the flesh of all others should be eaten, as belonging
to the class of things "most holy," by the priests alone
within the Holy Place. Hence Moses continued (ver.
18): "Behold, the blood of it was not brought into the
sanctuary within: ye should certainly have eaten it in
the sanctuary, as I commanded."</p>

<p>What had been done, as it appears, had been done
with Aaron's knowledge and sanction; for Aaron then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
answered in behalf of his sons (ver. 19): "Behold,
this day have they offered their sin offering and their
burnt offering before the Lord; and there have befallen
me such things as these: and if I had eaten the sin
offering to-day, would it have been well-pleasing in the
sight of the Lord?"</p>

<p>Of which answer, the intention seems to have been
this. In this day of special exaltation and privilege,
when for the first time they had performed their solemn
priestly duties, when most of all there should have
been the utmost care to please the Lord in the very
smallest things, His holy Name had been profaned by
the will-worship of his sons, and the wrath of God had
broken out against them, and, in them, against their
father's house. Could it be the will of God that a house
in which was found the guilt of such a sin, should yet
partake of the most holy things of God in the sanctuary?</p>

<p>From this it appears that the judgment sent into the
house of Aaron had had a most wholesome spiritual
effect. They had received such an impression of their
own profound sinfulness as they had never had before.
And it is very instructive to observe that they assume
to themselves a part in the sinfulness which had been
shown in the sin of Nadab and Abihu. It did not
occur to Aaron or his remaining sons to say, in the
spirit of Israel in the day of our Lord, "If we had
been in their place, we would not have done so."
Rather their consciences had been so awakened to the
holiness of God and their own inborn evil, that they
coupled themselves with the others as under the displeasure
of God. Was it possible, even though they
personally had not sinned, that such as they should
eat that which was most holy unto God? They had
thus in the letter disobeyed the law; but because their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
offence was begotten of a misapprehension, and only
showed how deeply and thoroughly they had taken to
heart the lesson of the sore judgment, we read that
"when Moses heard" their explanation, "it was well
pleasing in his sight."</p>

<p>All this which followed the sin of Nadab and Abihu,
and the judgment which fell on them, and thus upon
the whole house of Aaron, is a most instructive illustration
of the working of the chastising judgments of
the Lord, when rightly received. Its effect was to
awaken the utmost solicitude that nothing else might
be found about the tabernacle service, even through
oversight, which was not according to the mind of
God; and, in those immediately stricken, to produce a
very profound sense of personal sinfulness and unworthiness
before God. The New Testament gives us
a graphic description of this effect of the chastisement
of God on the believer, in the account which we have
of the result of the discipline which the Apostle Paul
inflicted on the sinning member of the Church of
Corinth; concerning which he afterward wrote to
them (2 Cor. vii. 11): "Behold, this selfsame thing,
that ye were made sorry after a godly sort, what earnest
care it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves,
yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what longing,
yea, what zeal, yea, what avenging!"</p>

<p>A good test is this, which, when we have passed
under the chastising hand of God, we may well apply
to ourselves: this "earnest care," this "clearing of
ourselves," this holy fear of a humbled heart,&mdash;have
we known what it means? If so, though we sorrow,
we may yet rejoice that by grace we are enabled to
sorrow "after a godly sort," with "a repentance which
bringeth no regret."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<h3><em>THE GREAT DAY OF ATONEMENT.</em></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lev.</span> xvi. 1-34.</p>


<p>In the first verse of chapter xvi., which ordains the
ceremonial for the great annual day of atonement,
we are told that this ordinance was delivered by the Lord
to Moses "after the death of the two sons of Aaron,
when they drew near before the Lord, and died."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
Because of the close historical connection thus declared
between this chapter and chapter x., and also because
in this ordinance the Mosaic sacrificial worship, which
has been the subject of the book thus far, finds its culmination,
it seems most satisfactory to anticipate the
order of the book by taking up at this point the exposition
of this chapter, before proceeding in chapter xi. to
a wholly different subject.</p>

<p>This ordinance of the day of atonement was perhaps
the most important and characteristic in the whole Mosaic
legislation. In the law of the offerings, the most distinctive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
part was the law of the sin-offering; and it
was on the great annual day of atonement that the
conceptions embodied in the sin-offering obtained their
most complete development. The central place which
this day occupied in the whole system of sacred times
is well illustrated in that it is often spoken of by
the rabbis, without any more precise designation,
as simply "<i>Yomà</i>," "The Day." It was "<i>the</i> day"
because, on this day, the idea of sacrificial expiation
and the consequent removal of all sin, essential to the
life of peace and fellowship with God, which was set
forth imperfectly, as regards individuals and the nation,
by the daily sin-offerings, received the highest possible
symbolical expression. It is plain that countless sins
and transgressions and various defilements must yet
have escaped unrecognised as such, even by the most
careful and conscientious Israelite; and that, for this
reason, they could not have been covered by any of
the daily offerings for sin. Hence, apart from this
full, solemn, typical purgation and cleansing of the
priesthood and the congregation, and the holy sanctuary,
from the uncleannesses and transgressions of the
children of Israel, "even all their sins" (ver. 16), the
sacrificial system had yet fallen short of expressing in
adequate symbolism the ideal of the complete removal
of all sin. With abundant reason then do the rabbis
regard it as the day of days in the sacred year.</p>

<p>It is insisted by the radical criticism of our day that
the general sense of sin and need of expiation which this
ordinance expresses could not have existed in the days
of Moses; and that since, moreover, the later historical
books of the Old Testament contain no reference to the
observance of the day, therefore its origin must be
attributed to the days of the restoration from Babylon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
when, as such critics suppose, the deeper sense of sin,
developed by the great judgment of the Babylonian
captivity and exile, occasioned the elaboration of this
ritual.</p>

<p>To this one might reply that the objection rests upon
an assumption which the Christian believer cannot admit,
that the ordinance was merely a product of the human
mind. But if, as our Lord constantly taught, and
as the chapter explicitly affirms, the ordinance was a
matter of Divine, supernatural revelation, then naturally
we shall expect to find in it, not man's estimate of the
guilt of sin, but God's, which in all ages is the same.</p>

<p>But, meeting such objectors on their own ground,
we need not go into the matter further than to refer
to the high authority of Dillmann, who declares this
theory of the post-exilian origin of this institution to
be "absolutely incredible;" and in reply to the objection
that the day is not alluded to in the whole Old
Testament history, justly adds that this argument from
silence would equally forbid us to assign the origin of
the ordinance to the days of the return from Babylon,
or any of the pre-Christian centuries! for "one would
then have to maintain that the festival first arose in the
first Christian century; since only out of that age do
we first have any explicit testimonies concerning it."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Again, the first verse of the chapter gives as the occasion
of the promulgation of this law, "the death of the
two sons of Aaron," Nadab and Abihu, "when they
drew near before the Lord and died;" a historical note
which is perfectly natural if we have here a narrative
dating from Mosaic days, but which seems most objectless
and unlikely to have been entered, if the law were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
a late invention of rabbinical forgers. On that occasion
it was, as we read (v. 2), that "the Lord said unto
Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come
not at all times into the holy place within the veil,
before the mercy-seat which is upon the ark; that he
die not: for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy-seat."</p>

<p>Into this place of Jehovah's most immediate earthly
manifestation, even Aaron is to come only once a year,
and then only with atoning blood, as hereinafter
prescribed.</p>

<p>The object of the whole service of this day is represented
as atonement; expiation of sin, in the highest
and fullest sense then possible. It is said to be
appointed to make atonement for Aaron and for his
house (ver. 6), for the holy place, and for the tent of
meeting (vv. 15-17); for the altar of burnt-offering in
the outer court (vv. 18, 19); and for all the congregation
of Israel (vv. 20-22, 33); and this, not merely for
such sins of ignorance as had been afterward recognised
and acknowledged in the ordinary sin-offerings of each
day, but for "<em>all</em> the iniquities of the children of Israel,
and <em>all</em> their transgressions, even all their sins:" even
such as were still unknown to all but God (ver. 21).
The fact of such an ordinance for such a purpose
taught a most impressive lesson of the holiness of God
and the sinfulness of man, on the one hand, and, on
the other, the utter insufficiency of the daily offerings
to cleanse from all sin. Day by day these had been
offered in each year; and yet, as we read (Heb. ix. 8, 9),
the Holy Ghost this signified by this ordinance, "that
the way into the holy place hath not yet been made manifest;"
it was "a parable for the time now present;"
teaching that the temple sacrifices of Judaism could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
not "as touching the conscience, make the worshipper
perfect" (Heb. ix. 9). We may well reverse the judgment
of the critics, and say&mdash;not that the deepened
sense of sin in Israel was the cause of the day of atonement;
but rather, that the solemn observances of this
day, under God, were made for many in Israel a most
effective means to deepen the conviction of sin.</p>

<p>The time which was ordained for this annual observance
is significant&mdash;the tenth day of the seventh month.
It was appointed for the seventh month, as the sabbatic
month, in which all the related ideas of rest in God
and with God, in the enjoyment of the blessings of a
now complete redemption, received in the great feast
of tabernacles their fullest expression. It was therefore
appointed for that month, and for a day which
shortly preceded this greatest of the annual feasts, to
signify in type the profound and most vital truth, that
the full joy of the sabbatic rest of man with God, and
the ingathering of the fruits of complete redemption,
is only possible upon condition of repentance and the
fullest possible expiation for sin. It was appointed for
the tenth day of this month, no doubt, because in the
Scripture symbolism the number ten is the symbol of
completeness; and was fitly thus connected with a
service which signified expiation completed for the sins
of the year.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The observances appointed for the day had regard,
first, to the people, and, secondly, to the tabernacle
service. As for the former, it was commanded (ver. 29)
that they should "do no manner of work," observing
the day as a <em>Sabbath Sabbathon</em>, "a high Sabbath," or
"Sabbath of solemn rest" (ver. 31); and, secondly,
that they should "afflict their souls" (ver. 31), namely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
by solemn fasting, in visible sign of sorrow and
humiliation for sin. By which it was most distinctly
taught, that howsoever complete atonement may be, and
howsoever, in making that atonement through a sacrificial
victim, the sinner himself have no part, yet apart
from his personal repentance for his sins, that atonement
shall profit him nothing; nay, it was declared
(xxiii. 29), that if any man should fail on this point,
God would cut him off from his people. The law
abides as regards the greater sacrifice of Christ; except
we repent, we shall, even because of that sacrifice, only
the more terribly perish; because not even this supreme
exhibition of the holy love and justice of God has moved
us to renounce sin.</p>

<p>As regards the tabernacle service for the day, the
order was as follows. First, as most distinctive of the
ritual of the day, only the high-priest could officiate.
The other priests, who, on other occasions, served continually
in the holy place, must on this day, during
these ceremonies, leave it to him alone; taking their
place, themselves as sinners for whom also atonement
was to be made, with the sinful congregation of their
brethren. For it was ordered (ver. 17): "There shall
be no man in the tent of meeting when the high priest
goeth in to make atonement in the holy place, until he
come out," and the work of atonement be completed.</p>

<p>And the high priest could himself officiate only after
certain significant preparations. First (ver. 4), he must
"bathe in water" his whole person. The word used
in the original is different from that which is used of
the partial washings in connection with the daily ceremonial
cleansings; and, most suggestively, the same
complete washing is required as that which was ordered
in the law for the consecration of the priesthood, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
for cleansing from leprosy and other specific defilements.
Thus was expressed, in the clearest manner
possible, the thought, that the high priest, who shall be
permitted to draw near to God in the holiest place, and
there prevail with Him, must himself be wholly pure and
clean.</p>

<p>Then, having bathed, he must robe himself in a
special manner for the service of this day. He must
lay aside the bright-coloured "garments for glory and
beauty" which he wore on all other occasions, and
put on, instead, a vesture of pure, unadorned white, like
that of the ordinary priest; excepting only that for him,
on this day, unlike them, the girdle also must be white.
By this substitution of these garments for his ordinary
brilliant robes was signified, not merely the absolute
purity which the white linen symbolised, but especially
also, by the absence of adornment, humiliation for sin.
On this day he was thus made in outward appearance
essentially like unto the other members of his house,
for whose sin, together with his own, he was to make
atonement.</p>

<p>Thus washed and robed, wearing on his white
turban the golden crown inscribed "Holiness to
Jehovah" (Exod. xxviii. 38), he now took (vv. 3, 5-7),
as a sin-offering for himself and for his house, a
bullock; and for the congregation, "two he-goats for
a sin offering;" with a ram for himself, and one for
them, for a burnt offering. The two goats were set
"before the Lord at the door of the tent of meeting."
The bullock was the offering before prescribed for the
sin-offering for the high priest (iv. 3), as being the
most valuable of all sacrificial victims. For the choice
of the goats many reasons have been given, none of
which seem wholly satisfactory. Both of the goats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
are equally declared (ver. 5) to be "for a sin offering;"
yet only one was to be slain.</p>

<p>The ceremonial which followed is unique; it is
without its like either in Mosaism or in heathenism. It
was ordered (ver. 8): "Aaron shall cast lots upon the
two goats; one lot for the Lord, and the other lot for
Azazel;" an expression to which we shall shortly
return. Only the goat on whom the lot fell for the
Lord was to be slain.</p>

<p>The two goats remain standing before the Lord;
while now Aaron kills the sin-offering for himself and
for his house (ver. 11); then enters, first, the Holy of
Holies within the veil, having taken (ver. 12) a censer
"full of coals of fire from off the altar before the
Lord," with his hands full of incense (ver. 13), "that
the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy-seat that
is upon the testimony (<em>i.e.</em>, the two tables of the law
within the ark), that he die not." Then (ver. 13) he
sprinkles the blood "upon the mercy-seat on the
east"&mdash;by which was signified the application of the
blood God-ward, accompanied with the fragrance of
intercession, for the expiation of his own sins and
those of his house; and then "seven times, before the
mercy-seat,"&mdash;evidently, on the floor of the sanctuary,
for the symbolic cleansing of the holiest place, defiled
by all the uncleannesses of the children of Israel, in the
midst of whom it stood. Then, returning, he kills the
goat of the sin-offering "for Jehovah," and repeats the
same ceremony, now in behalf of the whole congregation,
sprinkling, as before, the mercy-seat, and, seven
times, the Holy of Holies, thus making atonement for
it, "because of the uncleannesses of the children of
Israel, and because of their transgressions, even all
their sins" (ver. 16). In like manner, he was then to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
cleanse, by a seven-fold sprinkling, the Holy Place;
and then again going into the outer court, also the
altar of burnt-offering; this last, doubtless, as in other
cases, by applying the blood to the horns of the altar.</p>

<p>In all this it will be observed that the difference
from the ordinary sin-offerings and the wider reach of
its symbolical virtue is found, not in that the offering
is different from or larger than others, but in that,
symbolically speaking, the blood is brought, as in no
other offering, into the most immediate presence of
God; even into the secret darkness of the Holy of
Holies, where no child of Israel might tread. For
this reason did this sin-offering become, above all
others, the most perfect type of the one offering of
Him, the God-Man, who reconciled us to God by doing
that in reality which was here done in symbol, even
entering with atoning blood into the very presence of
God, there to appear in our behalf.</p>



<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Azazel.</span></p>

<p class="center">xvi. 20-28.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And when he hath made an end of atoning for the holy place, and
the tent of meeting, and the altar, he shall present the live goat: and
Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and
confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all
their transgressions, even all their sins; and he shall put them upon
the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a man
that is in readiness into the wilderness: and the goat shall bear upon
him all their iniquities unto a solitary land: and he shall let go the
goat in the wilderness. And Aaron shall come into the tent of meeting,
and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he
went into the holy place, and shall leave them there: and he shall
bathe his flesh in water in a holy place, and put on his garments, and
come forth, and offer his burnt offering and the burnt offering of the
people, and make atonement for himself and for the people. And the
fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar. And he that letteth
go the goat for Azazel shall wash his clothes, and bathe his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp. And
the bullock of the sin offering, and the goat of the sin offering, whose
blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall
be carried forth without the camp; and they shall burn in the fire
their skins, and their flesh, and their dung. And he that burneth
them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward
he shall come into the camp."</p></blockquote>

<p>And now followed the second stage of the ceremonial,
a rite of the most singular and impressive character.
The live goat, during the former part of the ceremony,
had been left standing before Jehovah, where he had
been placed after the casting of the lot (ver. 10). The
rendering of King James' version, that the goat was
so placed, "to make an atonement <em>with</em> him," assumes
a meaning to the Hebrew preposition here which it
never has. Usage demands either that which is given
in the text or the margin of the Revised Version, to make
atonement "<em>for</em> him" or "<em>over</em> him." But to the former
the objection seems insuperable that there is nothing
in the whole rite suggesting an atonement as made
for this living goat; while, on the other hand, if the
rendering "over" be adopted from the margin, it may
not unnaturally be understood of the performance <em>over</em>
this goat of that part of the atonement ceremonial
described as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Vv. 20-22: "When he hath made an end of atoning
for the holy place, and the tent of meeting, and the
altar, he shall present the live goat ... and confess over
him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all
their transgressions, even all their sins; and he shall
put them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him
away by the hand of a man that is in readiness into
the wilderness: and the goat shall bear upon him all
their iniquities unto a solitary land: and he shall let go
the goat in the wilderness." And with this ceremony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
the atonement was completed. Aaron now laid aside
the robes which he had put on for this service, bathed
again, and put on again his richly coloured garments
of office, came forth and offered the burnt-offering for
himself and for the people, and burnt the fat of the
sin-offering as usual on the altar (vv. 23-25), while its
flesh was burned, according to the law for such sacrifices,
without the camp (ver. 27).</p>

<p>What was the precise significance of this part of the
service, is one of the most difficult questions which
arises in the exposition of this book; the answer to
which chiefly turns upon the meaning which is attached
to the expression, "for Azazel" (O.V., "for a scapegoat").
What is the meaning of "Azazel"?</p>

<p>There are three fundamental facts which stand before
us in this chapter, which must find their place in any
explanation which may be adopted. 1. Both of the
goats are declared to be "a sin-offering;" the live goat,
no less than the other. 2. In consistency with this, the
live goat, no less than the other, was consecrated to
Jehovah, in that he was "set alive before the Lord."
3. The function expressly ascribed to him in the law
is the complete removal of the transgressions of Israel,
symbolically transferred to him as a burden, by the
laying on of hands with confession of sin. Passing by,
then, several interpretations, which seem intrinsically
irreconcilable with one or other of these facts, or are,
for other reasons, to be rejected, the case seems to be
practically narrowed down to this alternative. Either
Azazel is to be regarded as the name of an evil spirit,
conceived of as dwelling in the wilderness, or else it is
to be taken as an abstract noun, as in the margin (R.V.),
signifying "removal," "dismissal." That the word
may have this meaning is very commonly admitted even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
by those who deny that meaning here; and if, with
Bähr<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and others, we adopt it in this passage, all that
follows is quite clear. The goat "for removal" bears
away all the iniquities of Israel, which are symbolically
laid upon him, into a solitary land; that is, they are
taken wholly away from the presence of God and from
the camp of His people. Thus, as the killing and
sprinkling of the blood of the first goat visibly set forth
the <em>means</em> of reconciliation with God, through the substituted
offering of an innocent victim, so the sending
away of the second goat, laden with those sins, the
expiation of which had been signified by the sacrifice of
the first, no less vividly set forth the <em>effect</em> of that
sacrifice, in the complete removal of those expiated sins
from the holy presence of Jehovah. That this effect of
atonement should have been adequately represented by
the first slain victim was impossible; hence the necessity
for the second goat, ideally identified with the other,
as jointly constituting with it one sin-offering, whose
special use it should be to represent the blessed effect
of atonement. The truth symbolised, as the goat thus
bore away the sins of Israel, is expressed in those glad
words (Psalm ciii. 12), "As far as the east is from
the west, so far hath He removed our transgressions
from us;" or, under another image, by Micah (vii. 19),
"Thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the
sea."</p>

<p>So far all seems quite clear, and this explanation, no
doubt, will always be accepted by many.</p>

<p>And yet there remains one serious objection to this
interpretation; namely, that the meaning we thus give
this word "Azazel" is not what we would expect from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
the phrase which is used regarding the casting of the
lots (ver. 8): "One lot for the Lord, and the other lot
for Azazel." These words do most naturally suggest
that Azazel is the name of a person, who is here contrasted
with Jehovah; and hence it is believed by a
large number of the best expositors that the term must
be taken here as the name of an evil spirit, represented
as dwelling in the wilderness, to whom this goat, thus
laden with Israel's sins, is sent. In addition to this
phraseology, it is urged, in support of this interpretation,
that even the Scripture lends apparent sanction to
the Jewish belief that demons are, in some special sense,
the inhabitants of waste and desolate places; and, in
particular, that Jewish demonology does in fact recognise
a demon named Azazel, also called Sammael. It
is admitted, indeed, that the name Azazel does not
occur in the Scripture as the name of Satan or of any
evil spirit; and, moreover, that there is no evidence
that the Jewish belief concerning the existence of a
demon called Azazel dates nearly so far back as Mosaic
days; and, again, that even the rabbis themselves are
not agreed on this interpretation here, many of them
rejecting it, even on traditional grounds. Still the interpretation
has secured the support of the majority of
the best modern expositors, and must claim respectful
consideration.</p>

<p>But if Azazel indeed denotes an evil spirit to whom
the second goat of the sin-offering is thus sent, laden
with the iniquities of Israel, the question then arises:
How then, on this supposition, is the ceremony to be
interpreted?</p>

<p>The notion of some, that we have in this rite a relic
of the ancient demon-worship, is utterly inadmissible.
For this goat is expressly said (ver. 5) to have been,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
equally with the goat that was slain, "a sin-offering,"
and (vv. 10, 20) it is placed "before the Lord," as an
offering to Him; nor is there a hint, here or elsewhere,
that this goat was sacrificed in the wilderness to this
Azazel; while, moreover, in this very priest-code (xvii.
7-9, R.V.) this special form of idolatry is forbidden,
under the heaviest penalty.</p>

<p>That the goat sent to Azazel personified, by way of
warning and in a typical manner, Israel, as rejecting
the great Sin-offering, and thus laden with iniquity, and
therefore delivered over to Satan, is an idea equally
untenable. For the goat, as we have seen, is regarded
as ideally one with the goat which is slain; they jointly
constitute one sin-offering. If, therefore, the slain goat
represented in type Christ as the Lamb of God, our
Sin-offering, so also must this goat represent Him as
our Sin-offering. Further, the ceremonial which is
performed over him is explicitly termed an "atonement;"
that is, it was an essential part of a ritual
designed to symbolise, not the condemnation of Israel
for sin, but their complete deliverance from the guilt
of their sins.</p>

<p>Not to speak of other explanations, more or less
untenable, which have each found their advocates, the
only one which, upon this understanding of the meaning
of Azazel, the context and the analogy of the
Scripture will both admit, appears to be the following.
Holy Scripture teaches that Satan has power over man,
only because of man's sin. Because of his sin, man is
judicially left by God in Satan's power (1 John v. 19,
R.V.). When as "the prince of this world" he came
to the sinless Man, Jesus Christ, he had nothing in
Him, because He was the Holy One of God; while,
on the other hand, he is represented (Heb. ii. 14) as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
having over men under sin "the authority of death."
In full accord with this conception, he is represented,
both in the Old and the New Testament, as the accuser
of God's people. He is said to have accused Job before
God (Job i. 9-11; ii. 4, 5). When Zechariah (iii. 1)
saw Joshua the high-priest standing before the angel
of Jehovah, he saw Satan also standing at his right
hand to be his "adversary." So, again, in the Apocalypse
(xii. 10) he is called "the Accuser of our brethren,
which accuseth them before our God day and night,"
and who is only overcome by means of "the blood of
the Lamb."</p>

<p>To this Evil One, then, the Accuser and Adversary
of God's people in all ages&mdash;if we assume the interpretation
before us&mdash;the live goat was symbolically sent,
bearing on him the sins of Israel. But does he bear
their sins as forgiven, or as unforgiven? Surely, as
forgiven; for the sins which he symbolically carries
are those very sins of the bygone year for which
expiating blood had just been offered and accepted in
the Holy of Holies. Moreover, he is sent as being
ideally one with the goat that was slain. As sent to
Azazel, he therefore symbolically announces to the Evil
One that with the expiation of sin by sacrificial blood
the foundation of his power over forgiven Israel is gone.
His accusations are now no longer in place; for the
whole question of Israel's sin has been met and settled
in the atoning blood. Thus, as the acceptance of the
blood of the one goat offered in the Holiest symbolised
the complete propitiation of the offended holiness of
God and His pardon of Israel's sin, so the sending of
the goat to Azazel symbolised the <em>effect</em> of this expiation,
in the complete removal of all the penal effects
of sin, through deliverance by atonement from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
power of the Adversary as the executioner of God's
wrath.</p>

<p>Which of these two interpretations shall be accepted
must be left to the reader: that neither is without
difficulty, those who have most studied this very obscure
question will most readily admit; that either is at
least consistent with the context and with other teachings
of Scripture, should be sufficiently evident. In
either case, the symbolic intention of the first part of
the ritual, with the first goat, was to symbolise the
<em>means</em> of reconciliation with God; namely, through the
offering unto God of the life of an innocent victim,
substituted in the sinner's place: in either case alike,
the purpose of the second part of the ceremonial, with
the second goat, was to symbolise the blessed <em>effect</em> of
this expiation; either, if the reading of the margin be
taken, in the complete removal of the expiated sin from
the presence of the Holy God, or, if Azazel be taken
as a proper name, in the complete deliverance of the
sinner, through expiatory blood presented in the Holiest,
from the power of Satan. If in the former case, we
think of the words already cited, "As far as the east
is from the west, so far hath He removed our transgressions
from us;" in the latter the words from the
Apocalypse (xii. 10, 11) come to mind, "The Accuser
of our brethren is cast down, which accuseth them
before our God day and night. And they overcame
him because of the blood of the Lamb."</p>

<p>On other particulars in the ceremonial of the day we
need not dwell, as they have received their exposition
in earlier chapters of the law of the offerings. Of the
burnt-offerings, indeed, which followed the dismissal
of the living goat of the sin-offering, little is said; it
is, emphatically, the sin-offering upon which, above all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
else, it was designed to centre the attention of Israel
on this occasion.</p>

<p>And so, with an injunction to the perpetual observance
of this day, this remarkable chapter closes. In
it the sacrificial law of Moses attains its supreme
expression; the holiness and the grace alike of Israel's
God, their fullest revelation. For the like of the great
day of atonement, we look in vain in any other people.
If every sacrifice pointed to Christ, this most luminously
of all. What the fifty-third of Isaiah is to his
Messianic prophecies, that, we may truly say, is the
sixteenth of Leviticus to the whole system of Mosaic
types,&mdash;the most consummate flower of the Messianic
symbolism. All the sin-offerings pointed to Christ,
the great High Priest and Victim of the future; but
this, as we shall now see, with a distinctness found in
no other.</p>

<p>As the unique sin-offering of this day could only be
offered by the one high-priest, so was it intimated
that the High Priest of the future, who should
indeed make an end of sin, should be one and only.
As once only in the whole year, a complete cycle
of time, this great atonement was offered, so did
it point toward a sacrifice which should indeed be
"once for all" (Heb. ix. 26; x. 10); not only for the
lesser æon of the year, but for the æon of æons which
is the lifetime of humanity. In that the high-priest,
who was on all other occasions conspicuous among his
sons by his bright garments made for glory and for
beauty, on this occasion laid them aside, and assumed
the same garb as his sons for whom he was to
make atonement; herein was shadowed forth the truth
that it behoved the great High Priest of the future to
be "in all things made like unto His brethren" (Heb.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
ii. 17). When, having offered the sin-offering, Aaron
disappeared from the sight of Israel within the veil,
where in the presence of the unseen glory he offered
the incense and sprinkled the blood, it was presignified
how "Christ having come a High Priest of the good
things to come, through the greater and more perfect
tabernacle, not made with hands, ... nor yet through
the blood of goats and calves, but through His own
blood, entered in once for all into the holy place," even
"into heaven itself, now to appear before the face of
God for us" (Heb. ix. 11, 12, 24). And, in like manner,
in that when the sin-offering had been offered, the
blood sprinkled, and his work within the veil was
ended, arrayed again in his glorious garments, he reappeared
to bless the waiting congregation; it was
again foreshown how yet that must be fulfilled which
is written, that this same Christ, "having been once
offered to bear the sins of many, shall appear a second
time, apart from sin, to them that wait for Him, unto
salvation" (Heb. ix. 28).</p>

<p>To all this yet more might be added of dispensational
truth typified by the ceremonial of this day,
which we defer to the exposition of chap. xxv., where
its consideration more properly belongs. But even
were this all, what a marvellous revelation here of the
Lord Jesus Christ! The fact of these correspondences
between the Levitical ritual and the New Testament
facts, let it be observed, is wholly independent of the
questions as to the date and origin of this law; and
every theory on this subject must find a place for these
correspondences and account for them. But how can
any one believe that all these are merely accidental
coincidences of a post-exilian forgery with the facts
of the incarnation, and the high priestly work of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">&nbsp;</a></span>
Christ in death and resurrection as set forth in the
Gospels? How can they all be adequately accounted
for, except by assuming that to be true which is expressly
taught in the New Testament concerning this
very ritual: that in it the Holy Ghost presignified things
that were to come; that, therefore, the ordinance must
have been, not of man, but of God; not a mere product
of the human mind, acting under the laws of a
religious evolution, but a revelation from Him unto
whom "known are all His works from the foundation
of the world"?</p>

<p>Nor must we fail to take in the blessed truth so
vividly symbolised in the second part of the ceremonial.
When the blood of the sin-offering had been sprinkled
in the Holiest, the sins of Israel were then, by the
other goat of the sin-offering, borne far away. Israel
stood there still a sinful people; but their sin, now
expiated by the blood, was before God as if it were not.
So does the Holy Victim in the Antitype, who first by
His death expiated sin, then as the Living One bear
away all the believer's sins from the presence of the
Holy One into a land of forgetfulness. And so it is
that, as regards acceptance with God, the believing
sinner, though still a sinner, stands as if he were sinless;
all through the great Sin-offering. To see this,
to believe in it and rest in it, is life eternal; it is joy,
and peace, and rest! <span class="smcap">It is the Gospel!</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">&nbsp;</a></span></p>

<h3><em>CLEAN AND UNCLEAN ANIMALS, AND DEFILEMENT
BY DEAD BODIES.</em></h3>

<p class="center"><em>Lev.</em> xi. 1-47.</p>


<p>With chap. xi. begins a new section of this
book, extending to the end of chap. xv., of
which the subject is the law concerning various bodily
defilements, and the rites appointed for their removal.</p>

<p>The law is given under four heads, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="hanging">
I. Clean and Unclean Animals, and Defilement by Dead Bodies: chap. xi.</p>
<p class="hanging">II. The Uncleanness of Child-birth: chap. xii.</p>
<p class="hanging">III. The Uncleanness of Leprosy: chaps. xiii., xiv.</p>
<p class="hanging">IV. The Uncleanness of Issues: chap. xv.</p>

<p>From the modern point of view this whole subject
appears to many, with no little reason, to be encompassed
with peculiar difficulties. We have become
accustomed to think of religion as a thing so exclusively
of the spirit, and so completely independent of bodily
conditions, provided that these be not in their essential
nature sinful, that it is a great stumbling-block to many
that God should be represented as having given to
Israel an elaborate code of laws concerning such subjects
as are treated in these five chapters of Leviticus:
a legislation which, to not a few, seems puerile and unspiritual,
if not worse. And yet, for the reverent believer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
in Christ, who remembers that our blessed Lord did
repeatedly refer to this book of Leviticus as, without
any exception or qualification, the Word of His Father,
it should not be hard, in view of this fact, to infer that
the difficulties which most of us have felt are presumably
due to our very imperfect knowledge of the
subject. Remembering this, we shall be able to
approach this part of the law of Moses, and, in particular,
this chapter, with the spirit, not of critics, but of
learners, who know as yet but little of the mysteries
of God's dealings with Israel or with the human
race.</p>

<p>Chap. xi. may be divided into two sections, together
with a concluding appeal and summary (vv. 41-47).
The first section treats of the law of the clean and the
unclean in relation to eating (vv. 1-23). Under this
head, the animals which are permitted or forbidden are
classified, after a fashion not scientific, but purely
empirical and practical, into (1) the beasts which are
upon the earth (vv. 2-8); (2) things that are in the
waters (vv. 9-12); (3) flying things,&mdash;comprising, first,
birds and flying animals like the bat (vv. 13-19); and,
secondly, insects, "winged creeping things that go upon
all four" (vv. 20-23).</p>

<p>The second section treats of defilement by contact
with the dead bodies of these, whether unclean (vv.
24-38), or clean (vv. 39, 40).</p>

<p>Of the living things among the beasts that are upon
the earth (vv. 2-8), those are permitted for food which
both chew the cud and divide the hoof; every animal
in which either of these marks is wanting is forbidden.
Of the things which live in the waters, those only are
allowed for food which have both fins and scales; those
which lack either of these marks, such as, for example,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
eels, oysters, and all the mollusca and crustacea, are
forbidden (vv. 9-12). Of flying things (vv. 13-19)
which may be eaten, no special mark is given; though
it is to be noted that nearly all of those which are by
name forbidden are birds of prey, or birds reputed to be
unclean in their habits. All insects, "winged creeping
things that go upon all four" (ver. 20), or "whatsoever
hath many feet," or "goeth upon the belly," as worms,
snakes, etc., are prohibited (ver. 42). Of insects, a
single class, described as those "which have legs above
their feet, to leap withal upon the earth," is excepted
(vv. 21, 22): these are known to us as the order <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Saltatoria</i>,
including, as typical examples, the cricket, the
grasshopper, and the migratory locust; all of which,
it may be noted, are clean feeders, living upon vegetable
products only. It is worthy of notice that the
law of the clean and the unclean in food is not extended,
as it was in Egypt, to the vegetable kingdom.</p>

<p>The second section of the chapter (vv. 24-40) comprises
a number of laws relating chiefly to defilement
by contact with the dead bodies of animals. In these
regulations, it is to be observed that the dead body,
even of a clean animal, except when killed in accordance
with the law, so that its blood is all drained out
(xvii. 10-16), is regarded as defiling him who touches
it; while, on the other hand, even an unclean animal
is not held capable of imparting defilement by mere
contact, so long as it is living. Very minute charges
are given (vv. 29-38) concerning eight species of unclean
animals, of which six (vv. 29, 30, R.V.) appear
to be different varieties of the lizard family. Regarding
these, it is ordered that not only shall the person
be held unclean who touches the dead body of one of
them (ver. 31), but also anything becomes unclean on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
which such a dead body may fall, whether household
utensil, or food, or drink (vv. 32-35). The exception
only is made (vv. 36-38), that fountains, or wells of
water, or dry seed for sowing, shall not be held to be
by such defiled.</p>

<p>That which has been made unclean must be put into
water, and be unclean until the even (ver. 32); with
the exception that nothing which is made of earthenware,
whether a vessel, or an oven, or a range, could
be thus cleansed; for the obvious reason that the
water could not adequately reach the interior of its
porous material. It must therefore be broken in pieces
(vv. 33, 34). If a person be defiled by any of these,
he remained unclean until the even (ver. 31). No
washing is prescribed, but, from analogy, is probably to
be taken for granted.</p>

<p>Such is a brief summary of the law of the clean and
the unclean as contained in this chapter. To preclude
adding needless difficulty to a difficult subject, the
remark made above should be specially noted,&mdash;that so
far as general marks are given by which the clean is
to be distinguished from the unclean, these marks are
evidently selected simply from a practical point of view,
as of easy recognition by the common people, for
whom a more exact and scientific mode of distinction
would have been useless. We are not therefore for a
moment to think of cleanness or uncleanness as causally
determined, for instance, by the presence or absence of
fins or scales, or by the habit of chewing the cud, and
the dividing of the hoof, or the absence of these marks,
as if they were themselves the ground of the cleanness
or uncleanness, in any instance. For such a fancy as
this, which has diverted some interpreters from the
right line of investigation of the subject, there is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
warrant whatever in the words of the law, either here
or elsewhere.</p>

<p>Than this law concerning things clean and unclean
nothing will seem to many, at first, more alien to
modern thought, or more inconsistent with any intelligent
view of the world and of man's relation to the
things by which he is surrounded. And, especially,
that the strict observance of this law should be connected
with religion, and that, upon what professes to
be the authority of God, it should be urged on Israel
on the ground of their call to be a holy people to a holy
God,&mdash;this, to the great majority of Bible readers,
certainly appears, to say the least, most extraordinary
and unaccountable. And yet the law is here, and its
observance is enforced by this very consideration; for
we read (vv. 43, 44): "Ye shall not make yourselves
abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth,
neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them,
that ye should be defiled thereby. For I am the Lord
your God: sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye
holy; for I am holy." And, in any case, explain the
matter as we may, many will ask, How, since the New
Testament formally declares this law concerning clean
and unclean beasts to be no longer binding (Col. ii. 16,
20-23), is it possible to imagine that there should
now remain anything in this most perplexing law
which should be of spiritual profit still to a New
Testament believer? To the consideration of these
questions, which so naturally arise, we now address
ourselves.</p>

<p>First of all, in approaching this subject it is well to
recall to mind the undeniable fact, that a distinction in
foods as clean and unclean, that is, fit and unfit for
man's use, has a very deep and apparently irremovable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
foundation in man's nature. Even we ourselves, who
stumble at this law, recognise a distinction of this kind,
and regulate our diet accordingly; and also, in like
manner, feel, more or less, an instinctive repugnance to
dead bodies. As regards diet, it is true that when the
secondary question arises as to what particular animals
shall be reckoned clean or unclean, fit or unfit for food,
nations and tribes differ among themselves, as also
from the law of Moses, in a greater or less degree;
nevertheless, this does not alter the fact that such a
distinction is recognised among all nations of culture;
and that, on the other hand, in those who recognise
it not, and who eat, as some do, without discrimination,
whatever chances to come to hand,&mdash;insects, reptiles,
carrion, and so on,&mdash;this revolting indifference in the
matter of food is always associated with gross
intellectual and moral degradation. Certainly these
indisputable facts should suffice to dispose of the
charge of puerility, as sometimes made against the
laws of this chapter.</p>

<p>And not only this, but more is true. For while even
among nations of the highest culture and Christian
enlightenment many animals are eaten, as, <em>e.g.</em>, the
oyster, the turtle, the flesh of the horse and the hog,
which the law of Moses prohibits; on the other hand,
it remains true that, with the sole exception of creatures
of the locust tribe, the animals which are allowed for
food by the Mosaic code are reckoned suitable for
food by almost the entire human family. A notable
exception to the fact is indeed furnished in the case
of the Hindoos, and also the Buddhists (who follow an
Indian religion), who, as a rule, reject all animal food,
and especially, in the case of the former, the flesh of the
cow, as not to be eaten. But this exception is quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
explicable by considerations into which we cannot here
enter at length, but which do not affect the significance
of the general fact.</p>

<p>And, again, on the other hand, it may also be said
that, as a general rule, the appetite of the great
majority of enlightened and cultivated nations revolts
against using as food the greater part of the animals
which this code prohibits. Birds of prey, for instance,
and the carnivora generally, animals having paws, and
reptiles, for the most part, by a kind of universal
instinct among cultivated peoples, are judged unfit for
human food.</p>

<p>The bearing of these facts upon our exposition is
plain. They certainly suggest, at least, that this law
of Lev. xi. may, after all, very possibly have a deep
foundation both in the nature of man and that of the
things permitted or forbidden; and they also raise
the question as to how far exceptions and divergencies
from this law, among peoples of culture, may
possibly be due to a diversity in external physical and
climatic conditions, because of which that which may
be wholesome and suitable food in one place&mdash;the wilderness
of Sinai, or Palestine, for instance&mdash;may not
be wholesome and suitable in other lands, under different
physical conditions. We do not yet enter into
this question, but barely call attention to it, as adapted
to check the hasty judgment of many, that such a law
as this is necessarily puerile and unworthy of God.</p>

<p>But while it is of no small consequence to note this
agreement in the fundamental ideas of this law with
widely extended instincts and habits of mankind, on
the other hand, it is also of importance to emphasise
the contrast which it exhibits with similar codes of
law among other peoples. For while, as has just been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
remarked, there are many most suggestive points
of agreement between the Mosaic distinctions of clean
and unclean and those of other nations, on the other
hand, remarkable contrasts appear, even in the case
of those people with whom, like the Egyptians, the
Hebrews had been most intimately associated. In
the Egyptian system of dietary law, for instance, the
distinction of clean and unclean in food was made to
apply, not only in the animal, but also in the vegetable
world; and, again, while all fishes having fins and
scales are permitted as food in the Mosaic law, no
fishes whatever are permitted by the Egyptian code.
But more significant than such difference in details is
the difference in the religious conception upon which
such distinctions are based. In Egypt, for example,
animals were reckoned clean or unclean according as
they were supposed to have more predominant the
character of the good Osiris or of the evil Typhon.
Among the ancient Persians, those were reckoned
clean which were supposed to be the creation of
Ormazd, the good Spirit, and those unclean whose
origin was attributed to Ahriman, the evil Spirit. In
India, the prohibition of flesh as food rests on pantheistic
assumptions. Not to multiply examples, it is
easy to see that, without anticipating anything here
with regard to the principle which determined the
Hebrew distinctions, it is certain that of such dualistic
or pantheistic principles as are manifested in these
and other instances which might be named, there is not
a trace in the Mosaic law. How significant and profoundly
instructive is the contrast here, will only fully
appear when we see what in fact appears to have been
the determining principle in the Mosaic legislation.</p>

<p>But when we now seek to ascertain upon what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
principle certain animals were permitted and others
forbidden as food, it must be confessed that we have
before us a very difficult question, and one to which,
accordingly, very diverse answers have been given.
In general, indeed, we are expressly told that the
object of this legislation, as of all else in this book of
laws, was moral and spiritual. Thus, we are told in
so many words (vv. 43-45) that Israel was to abstain
from eating or touching the unclean, on the ground
that they were to be holy, because the Lord their God
was holy. But to most this only increases the difficulty.
What possible connection could there be
between eating, or abstinence from eating, animals
which do not chew the cud, or fishes which have not
scales, and holiness of life?</p>

<p>In answer to this question, some have supposed a
mystical connection between the soul and the body,
such that the former is defiled by the food which is
received and assimilated by the latter. In support of
this theory, appeal has been made to ver. 44 of this
chapter, which, in the Septuagint translation, is rendered
literally: "Ye shall not defile your souls." But,
as often in Hebrew, the original expression here is
simply equivalent to our compound pronoun "yourselves,"
and is therefore so translated both in the
Authorised and the Revised Versions. As for any
other proof of such a mystical evil influence of the
various kinds of food prohibited in this chapter, there
is simply none at all.</p>

<p>Others, again, have sought the explication of these
facts in the undoubted Divine purpose of keeping
Israel separate from other nations; to secure which
separation this special dietetic code, with other laws
regarding the clean and the unclean, was given them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
That these laws have practically helped to keep the
children of Israel separate from other nations, will not
be denied; and we may therefore readily admit, that inasmuch
as the food of the Hebrews has differed from
that of the nations among whom they have dwelt, this
separation of the nation may therefore have been
included in the purpose of God in these regulations.
However, it is to be observed that in the law itself the
separation of Israel from other nations is represented,
not as the end to be attained by the observance of these
food laws, but instead, as a fact already existing, which
is given as a reason why they should keep these laws
(xx. 24, 25). Moreover, it will be found impossible,
by reference to this principle alone, to account for the
details of the laws before us. For the question is not
merely why there should have been food laws, but
also why these laws should have been such as they
are? The latter question is not adequately explained
by reference to God's purpose of keeping Israel separate
from the nations.</p>

<p>Some, again, have held that the explanation of these
laws was to be found simply in the design of God, by
these restrictions, to give Israel a profitable moral
discipline in self-restraint and control of the bodily
appetites; or to impose, in this way, certain conditions
and limitations upon their approach to Him, which
should have the effect of deepening in them the sense
of awe and reverence for the Divine majesty of God, as
their King. Of this theory it may be said, as of the
last-named, that there can be no doubt that in fact
these laws did tend to secure these ends; but that yet,
on the other hand, the explanation is still inadequate,
inasmuch as it only would show why restrictions of
some kind should have been ordered, and not, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
least, why the restrictions should have been such, in
detail, as we have here.</p>

<p>Quite different from any of these attempted explanations
is that of many who have sought to explain the
law allegorically. We are told by such that Israel was
forbidden the flesh of certain animals, because they were
regarded as typifying by their character certain sins and
vices, as, on the other hand, those which were permitted
as food were regarded as typifying certain moral virtues.
Hence, it is supposed by such that the law tended to
the holiness of Israel, in that it was, so to speak, a continual
object-lesson, a perpetually acted allegory, which
should continually remind them of the duty of abstaining
from the typified sins and of practising the typified
virtues. But, assuredly, this theory cannot be carried
out. Animals are in this law prohibited as food whose
symbolic meaning elsewhere in Scripture is not always
bad, but sometimes good. The lion, for example, as
having paws, is prohibited as food; and yet it is the
symbol of our blessed Lord, "the Lion of the tribe of
Judah." Nor is there the slightest evidence that the
Hebrews ever attached any such allegorical significance
to the various prescriptions of this chapter as the theory
would require.</p>

<p>Other expositors allegorise in a different but no more
satisfactory manner. Thus a popular, and, it must be
added, most spiritual and devout expositor, sets forth
the spiritual meaning of the required conjunction of the
two marks in clean animals of the chewing of the cud
and the dividing of the hoof in this wise: "The two
things were inseparable in the case of every clean
animal. And, as to the spiritual application, it is of the
very last importance in a practical point of view....
A man may profess to love and feed upon, to study<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
and ruminate over, the Word of God&mdash;the pasture of
the soul; but if his footprints along the pathway of life
are not such as the Word requires, he is not clean."</p>

<p>But it should be evident that such allegorising interpretation
as this can carry with it no authority, and
sets the door wide open to the most extravagant fancy
in the exposition of Scripture.</p>

<p>Others, again, find the only principle which has
determined the laws concerning defilement by the dead,
and the clean and unclean meats, to be the presence
in that which was reckoned unclean, of something which
is naturally repulsive to men; whether in odour, or in
the food of a creature, or its other habits of life. But
while it is true that such marks distinguish many of the
creatures reckoned unclean, they are wanting in others,
and are also found in a few animals which are nevertheless
permitted. If this had been the determining
principle, surely, for example, the law which permitted
for food the he-goat and forbade the horse, would have
been exactly the opposite; while, as regards fishes and
insects permitted and forbidden, it is hard to see any
evidence whatever of the influence of this principle.</p>

<p>Much more plausible, at first sight, and indeed much
more nearly approaching the truth, than any of the
theories above criticised, is one which has been
elaborated with no little learning and ingenuity by
Sommer,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> according to which the laws concerning the
clean and the unclean, whether in regard to food or
anything else, are all grounded in the antithesis of death
and life. Death, everywhere in Holy Scripture, is set
in the closest ethical and symbolical connection with
sin. Bodily death is the wages of sin; and inasmuch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
as it is the outward physical expression and result of
the inner fact that sin, in its very nature, is spiritual
death, therefore the dead is always held to be unclean;
and the various laws enforcing this thought are all
intended to keep before the mind the fact that death is
the visible representation and evidence of the presence
of sin, and the consequent curse of God. Hence, also,
it will follow that the selection of foods must be
governed by a reference to this principle. The
carnivora, on this principle, must be forbidden,&mdash;as
they are,&mdash;because they live by taking the life of other
animals; hence, also, is explained the exclusion of
the multitudinous varieties of the insect world, as
feeding on that which is dead and corrupt. On the
other hand, the animals which chew the cud and
divide the hoof are counted clean; inasmuch as the
sheep and the cattle, the chief representatives of this
class, were by every one recognised as at the furthest
possible remove from any such connection with death
and corruption in their mode of life; and hence the
familiar marks which distinguish them, as a matter
merely of practical convenience, were taken as those
which must distinguish every animal lawful for food.</p>

<p>But while this view has been elaborated with great
ability and skill, it yet fails to account for all the facts.
It is quite overlooked that if the reason of the prohibition
of carnivorous birds and quadrupeds is to be found
in the fact that they live by the destruction of life, the
same reason should have led to the prohibition of all
fishes without exception, as in Egypt; inasmuch as
those which have fins and scales, no less than others,
live by preying on other living creatures. On the other
hand, by the same principle, all insects which derive
their sustenance from the vegetable world should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
been permitted as food, instead of one order only of
these.</p>

<p>Where so much learning and profound thought has
been expended in vain, one might well hesitate to
venture anything in exposition of so difficult a subject,
and rest content, as some have, with declaring that the
whole subject is utterly inexplicable. And yet the
world advances in knowledge, and we are therefore
able to approach the subject with some advantage in
this respect over earlier generations. And in the light
of the most recent investigations, we believe it highly
probable that the chief principle determining the laws
of this chapter will be found in the region of hygiene
and sanitation, as relating, in this instance, to diet, and
to the treatment of that which is dead. And this in
view of the following considerations.</p>

<p>It is of much significance to note, in the first place,
that a large part of the animals which are forbidden as
food are unclean feeders. It is a well-ascertained fact
that even the cleanest animal, if its food be unclean,
becomes dangerous to health if its flesh be eaten. The
flesh of a cow which has drunk water contaminated
with typhoid germs, if eaten, especially if insufficiently
cooked, may communicate typhoid fever to him who
eats it. It is true, indeed, that not all animals that
are prohibited are unclean in their food; but the fact
remains that, on the other hand, among those which
are allowed is to be found no animal whose ordinary
habits of life, especially in respect of food, are unclean.</p>

<p>But, in the second place, an animal which is not
unclean in its habits may yet be dangerous for food,
if it be, for any reason, specially liable to disease.
One of the greatest discoveries of modern science is
the fact that a large number of diseases to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
animals are liable are due to the presence of low forms
of parasitic life. To such diseases those which are
unclean in their feeding will be especially exposed,
while none will perhaps be found wholly exempt.</p>

<p>Another discovery of recent times which has a no
less important bearing on the question raised by this
chapter is the now ascertained fact that many of these
parasitic diseases are common to both animals and
men, and may be communicated from the former to
the latter. All are familiar with the fact that the smallpox,
in a modified and mild form, is a disease of cattle
as well as of men, and we avail ourselves of this fact
in the practice of vaccination. Scarcely less familiar
is the communication of the parasitic trichinæ, which
often infest the flesh of swine, to those who eat such
meat. And research is constantly extending the number
of such diseases. Turkeys, we are now told, have the
diphtheria, and may communicate it to men; men also
sometimes take from horses the loathsome disease
known as the glanders. Now in the light of such
facts as these, it is plain that an ideal dietary law
would, as far as possible, exclude from human food
all animals which, under given conditions, might be
especially liable to these parasitic diseases, and which,
if their flesh should be eaten, might thus become a
frequent medium of communicating them to men.</p>

<p>Now it is a most remarkable and significant fact
that the tendency of the most recent investigations of
this subject has been to show that the prohibitions and
permissions of the Mosaic law concerning food, as we
have them in this chapter, become apparently explicable
in view of the above facts. Not to refer to other
authorities, among the latest competent testimonies on
this subject is that of Dr. Noel Gueneau de Mussy, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
a paper presented to the Paris Academy of Medicine
in 1885, in which he is quoted as saying: "There is
so close a connection between the thinking being and
the living organism in man, so intimate a solidarity
between moral and material interests, and the useful
is so constantly and so necessarily in harmony with
the good, that these two elements cannot be separated
in hygiene.... It is this combination which has
exercised so great an influence on the preservation of
the Israelites, despite the very unfavourable external
circumstances in which they have been placed.... The
idea of parasitic and infectious maladies, which has
conquered so great a position in modern pathology,
appears to have greatly occupied the mind of Moses,
and to have dominated all his hygienic rules. He
excludes from Hebrew dietary <em>animals particularly
liable to parasites</em>; and as it is in the blood that the
germs or spores of infectious disease circulate, he
orders that they must be drained of their blood before
serving for food."</p>

<p>If this professional testimony, which is accepted and
endorsed by Dr. Behrends, of London, in his remarkable
paper on "Diseases caught from Butcher's Meat,"<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> be
admitted, it is evident that we need look no further for
the explanation of the minute prescriptions of these
dietary laws which we find here and elsewhere in the
Pentateuch.</p>

<p>And, it may be added, that upon this principle we
may also easily explain, in a rational way, the very
minute prescriptions of the law with regard to defilement
by dead bodies. For immediately upon death begins a
process of corruption which produces compounds not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
only obnoxious to the senses, but actively poisonous in
character; and what is of still more consequence to
observe, in the case of all parasitic and infectious
diseases, the energy of the infection is specially intensified
when the infected person or animal dies. Hence
the careful regulations as to cleansing of those persons
or things which had been thus defiled by the dead;
either by water, where practicable; or where the thing
could not be thus thoroughly cleansed, then by burning
the article with fire, the most certain of all disinfectants.</p>

<p>But if this be indeed the principle which underlies
this law of the clean and the unclean as here given, it
will then be urged that since the Hebrews have observed
this law with strictness for centuries, they ought to
show the evidence of this in a marked immunity from
sickness, as compared with other nations, and especially
from diseases of an infectious character; and a consequent
longevity superior to that of the Gentiles who
pay no attention to these laws. Now it is the fact, and
one which evidently furnishes another powerful argument
for this interpretation of these laws, that this is
exactly what we see. In this matter we are not left to
guessing; the facts are before the world, and are undisputed.
Even so long ago as the days when the plague
was desolating Europe, the Jews so universally escaped
infection that, by this their exemption, the popular
suspicion was excited into fury, and they were accused
of causing the fearful mortality among their Gentile
neighbours by poisoning the wells and springs. In our
own day, in the recent cholera epidemic in Italy, a
correspondent of the <cite>Jewish Chronicle</cite> testifies that the
Jews enjoyed almost absolute immunity, at least from
fatal attack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>Professor Hosmer says: "Throughout the entire
history of Israel, the wisdom of the ancient lawgivers
in these respects has been remarkably shown. In times
of pestilence the Jews have suffered far less than others;
as regards longevity and general health, they have in
every age been noteworthy, and, at the present day,
in the life-insurance offices, the life of a Jew is said
to be worth much more than that of men of other
stock."</p>

<p>Of the facts in the modern world which sustain these
statements, Dr. Behrends gives abundant illustration in
the article referred to, such as the following: "In
Prussia, the mean duration of Jewish life averages five
years more than that of the general population. In
Furth, the average duration of Jewish life is 37, and of
Christians 26 years. In Hungary, an exhaustive study
of the facts shows that the average duration of life with
the Croats is 20·2, of the Germans 26·7, but of the
Jews 46·5 years, and that although the latter generally
are poor, and live under much more unfavourable
sanitary conditions than their Gentile neighbours."</p>

<p>In the light of such well-certified facts, the conclusion
seems certainly to be warranted, that at least one chief
consideration which, in the Divine wisdom, determined
the allowance or prohibition, as the food of Israel, of the
animals named in this chapter, has been their fitness
or unfitness as diet from a hygienic point of view,
especially regarding their greater or less liability to
have, and to communicate to man, infectious, parasitic
diseases.</p>

<p>From this position, if it be justified, we can now
perceive a secondary reference in these laws to the
deeper ethical truth which, with much reason, Sommer
has so emphasised; namely, the moral significance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
the great antithesis of death to life; the former being
ever contrasted in Holy Scripture with the latter, as the
visible manifestation of the presence of sin in the world,
and of the consequent curse of God. For whatever
tends to weakness or disease, by that fact tends to
death,&mdash;to that death which, according to the Scriptures,
is, for man, the penal consequence of sin. But Israel
was called to be a people redeemed from the power of
death to life, a life of full consecration to God. Hence,
because redeemed from death, it was evidently fitting
that the Israelite should, so far as possible in the flesh,
keep apart from death, and all that in its nature tended,
or might specially tend, to disease and death.</p>

<p>It is very strange that it should have been objected
to this view, that since the law declares the reason for
these regulations to have been religious, therefore any
supposed reference herein to the principles of hygiene
is by that fact excluded. For surely the obligation so
to live as to conserve and promote the highest bodily
health must be regarded, both from a natural, and
a Biblical and Christian point of view, as being no
less really a religious obligation than truthfulness or
honesty. If there appear sufficient reason for believing
that the details of these laws are to be explained by
reference to hygienic considerations, surely this, so far
from contradicting the reason which is given for their
observance, helps us rather the more clearly to see
how, just because Israel was called to be the holy
people of a holy God, they must needs keep this law.
For the central idea of the Levitical holiness was consecration
unto God, as the Creator and Redeemer of
Israel,&mdash;consecration in the most unreserved, fullest
possible sense, for the most perfect possible service.
But the obligation to such a consecration, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
essence of a holy character, surely carried with it, by
necessary consequence, then, as now, the obligation
to maintain all the powers of mind and body also in
the highest possible perfection. That, as regards the
body, and, in no small degree, the mind as well, this
involves the duty of the preservation of health, so far
as in our power; and that this, again, is conditioned
by the use of a proper diet, as one factor of prime
importance, will be denied by no one. If, then, sufficient
reason can be shown for recognising the determining
influence of hygienic considerations in the laws
of this chapter concerning the clean and the unclean,
this fact will only be in the fullest harmony with all
that is said in this connection, and elsewhere in the
law, as to the relation of their observance to Israel's
holiness as a consecrated nation.</p>

<p>It may very possibly be asked, by way of further
objection to this interpretation of these laws: Upon this
understanding of the immediate purpose of these laws,
how can we account for the selection of such test
marks of the clean and the unclean as the chewing of
the cud, and the dividing of the hoof, or having scales
and fins? What can the presence or absence of these
peculiarities have to do with the greater or less freedom
from parasitic disease of the animals included or
excluded in the several classes? To which question
the answer may fairly be given, that the object of the
law was not to give accurately distributed categories of
animals, scientifically arranged, according to hygienic
principles, but was purely practical; namely, to secure,
so far as possible, the observance by the whole people
of such a dietary as in the land of Palestine would, on
the whole, best tend to secure perfect bodily health.
It is not affirmed that every individual animal which by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
these tests may be excluded from permitted food is
therefore to be held specially liable to disease; but
only that the limitation of the diet by these test marks,
as a practical measure, would, <em>on the whole</em>, secure the
greatest degree of immunity from disease to those who
kept the law.</p>

<p>It may be objected, again, by some who have looked
into this question, that, according to recent researches,
it appears that cattle, which occupy the foremost place
in the permitted diet of the Hebrews, are found to
be especially liable to tubercular disease, and capable,
apparently, under certain conditions, of communicating
it to those who feed upon their flesh. And it has been
even urged that to this source is due a large part of
the consumption which is responsible for so large part
of our mortality. To which objection two answers
may be given. First, and most important, is the
observation that we have as yet no statistics as to
the prevalence of disease of this kind among cattle in
Palestine; and that, presumably, if we may argue from
the climatic conditions of its prevalence among men, it
would be found far less frequently there among cattle
than in Europe and America. Further, it must be
remembered that, in the case even of clean cattle, the
law very strictly provides elsewhere that the clean
animal which is slain for food shall be absolutely free
from disease; so that still we see here, no less than
elsewhere, the hygienic principles ruling the dietary
law.</p>

<p>It will be perhaps objected, again, that if all this be
true, then, since abstinence from unwholesome food is
a moral duty, the law concerning clean and unclean
meats should be of universal and perpetual obligation;
whereas, in fact, it is explicitly abrogated in the New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
Testament, and is not held to be now binding on any
one. But the abrogation of the law of Moses touching
clean and unclean food can be easily explained, in
perfect accord with all that has been said as to its
nature and intent. In the first place, it is to be
remembered that it is a fundamental characteristic of
the New Testament law as contrasted with that of
the Old, that on all points it leaves much more to the
liberty of the individual, allowing him to act according
to the exercise of an enlightened judgment, under the
law of supreme love to the Lord, in many matters
which, in the Old Testament day, were made a subject of
specific regulation. This is true, for instance, regarding
all that relates to the public worship of God, and also
many things in the government and administration of
the Church, not to speak of other examples. This
does not indeed mean that it is of no consequence what
a man or a Church may do in matters of this kind; but
it is intended thus to give the individual and the whole
Church a discipline of a higher order than is possible
under a system which prescribes a large part of the
details of human action. Subjection to these "rudiments"
of the law, according to the Apostle, belongs
to a condition of religious minority (Gal. iv. 1-3), and
passes away when the individual, or the Church, so to
speak, attains majority. Precisely so it is in the case
of these dietary and other laws, which, indeed, are
selected by the Apostle Paul (Col. ii. 20-22) in illustration
of this characteristic of the new dispensation.
That such matters of detail should no longer be made
matter of specific command is only what we should
expect according to the analogy of the whole system of
Christian law. This is not, indeed, saying that it is of
no consequence in a religious point of view what a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
eats; whether, for instance, he eat carrion or not,
though this, which was forbidden in the Old Testament,
is nowhere expressly prohibited in the New.
But still, as supplying a training of higher order, the
New Testament uniformly refrains from giving detailed
commandments in matters of this kind.</p>

<p>But, aside from considerations of this kind, there
is a specific reason why these laws of Moses concerning
diet and defilement by dead bodies, if hygienic
in character, should not have been made, in the New
Testament, of universal obligation, however excellent
they might be. For it is to be remembered that these
laws were delivered for a people few in number, living
in a small country, under certain definite climatic
conditions. But it is well known that what is unwholesome
for food in one part of the world may be,
and often is, necessary to the maintenance of health
elsewhere. A class of animals which under the
climatic conditions of Palestine may be specially liable
to certain forms of parasitic disease, under different
climatic conditions may be comparatively free from
them. Abstinence from fat is commanded in the law
of Moses (iii. 17), and great moderation in this matter
is necessary to health in hot climates; but, on the
contrary, to eat fat largely is necessary to life in the
polar regions. From such facts as these it would
follow, of necessity, that when the Church of God, as
under the new dispensation, was now to become a world-wide
organisation, still to have insisted on a dietetic
law perfectly adapted only to Palestine would have
been to defeat the physical object, and by consequence
the moral end, for which that law was given. Under
these conditions, except a special law were to be given
for each land and climate, there was and could be, if we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
have before us the true conception of the ground of
these regulations, no alternative but to abrogate the
law.</p>

<p>This exposition has been much prolonged; but not
until we have before us a definite conception as to the
principle underlying these regulations, and the relation
of their observance to the holiness of Israel, are we in
a position to see and appreciate the moral and spiritual
lessons which they may still have for us. As it is, if
the conclusions to which our exposition has conducted
be accepted, such lessons lie clearly before us. While
we have here a law which, as to the letter, is confessedly
abrogated, and which is supposed by the most
to be utterly removed from any present-day use for
practical instruction, it is now evident that, annulled as
to the letter, it is yet, as to the spirit and intention of
it, in full force and vital consequence to holiness of life
in all ages.</p>

<p>In the first place, this exposition being granted, it
follows, as a present-day lesson of great moment, that
the holiness which God requires has to do with the
body as well as the soul, even with such commonplace
matters as our eating and drinking. This is so,
because the body is the instrument and organ of the
soul, with which it must do all its work on earth for
God, and because, as such, the body, no less than the
soul, has been redeemed unto God by the blood of His
Son. There is, therefore, no religion in neglecting the
body, and ignoring the requirements for its health, as
ascetics have in all ages imagined. Neither is there
religion in pampering, and thus abusing, the body, after
the manner of the sensual in all ages. The principle
which inspires this chapter is that which is expressed
in the New Testament by the words: "Whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do
all to the glory of God" (1 Cor. x. 31). If,
therefore, a man needlessly eats such things, or in
such a manner, as may be injurious to health, he sins,
and has come short of the law of perfect holiness. It
is therefore not merely a matter of earthly prudence to
observe the laws of health in food and drink and
recreation, in a word, in all that has to do with the
appetite and desires of the body, but it is essential to
holiness. We are in all these things to seek to glorify
God, not only in our souls, but also in our bodies.</p>

<p>The momentous importance of this thought will the
more clearly appear when we recall to mind that,
according to the law of Moses (v. 2), if a man was
defiled by any unclean thing, and neglected the
cleansing ordered by this law, even though it were
through ignorance or forgetfulness, he was held to
have incurred guilt before God. For it was therein
declared that when a man defiled by contact with the
dead, or any unclean thing, should for any reason have
omitted the cleansing ordered, his covenant relation with
God could only be re-established on his presentation
of a sin-offering. By parity of reasoning it follows
that the case is the same now; and that God will hold
no man guiltless who violates any of those laws which
He has established in nature as the conditions of bodily
health. He who does this is guilty of a sin which
requires the application of the great atonement.</p>

<p>How needful it is even in our day to remind men of
all this, could not be better illustrated than by the
already mentioned argument of many expositors, that
hygienic principles cannot have dominated and determined
the details of these laws, because the law
declares that they are grounded, not in hygiene, but in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
religion, and have to do with holiness. As if these
two were exclusive, one of the other, and as if it
made no difference in respect to holiness of character
whether a man took care to have a sound body or
not!</p>

<p>No less needful is the lesson of this law to many
who are at the opposite extreme. For as there are
those who are so taken up with the soul and its health,
that they ignore its relation to the body, and the
bearing of bodily conditions upon character; so there
are others who are so preoccupied with questions of
bodily health, sanitation and hygiene, regarded merely
as prudential measures, from an earthly point of view,
that they forget that man has a soul as well as a
body, and that such questions of sanitation and
hygiene only find their proper place when it is
recognised that health and perfection of the body are
not to be sought merely that man may become a more
perfect animal, but in order that thus, with a sound
mind in a sound body, he may the more perfectly
serve the Lord in the life of holiness to which we are
called. Thus it appears that this forgotten law of
the clean and the unclean in food, so far from being,
at the best, puerile, and for us now certainly quite
useless, still teaches us the very important lesson that
a due regard to wholeness and health of body is
essential to the right and symmetrical development
of holiness of character. In every dispensation, the
law of God combines the bodily and the spiritual in
a sacred synthesis. If in the New Testament we are
directed to glorify God in our spirits, we are no less
explicitly commanded to glorify God in our bodies
(1 Cor. vi. 20). And thus is given to the laws of
health the high sanction of the Divine obligation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
moral law, as summed up in the closing words of this
chapter: "Be ye holy; for I am holy."</p>

<p>This law concerning things unclean, and clean and
unclean animals, as thus expounded, is also an apologetic
of no small value. It has a direct and evident
bearing on the question of the Divine origin and
authority of this part of the law. For the question will
at once come up in every reflecting mind: Whence
came this law? Could it have been merely an invention
of crafty Jewish priests? Or is it possible to account
for it as the product merely of the mind of Moses? It
appears to have been ordered with respect to certain
facts, especially regarding various invisible forms of
noxious parasitic life, in their bearing on the causation
and propagation of disease,&mdash;facts which, even now, are
but just appearing within the horizon of modern science.
Is it probable that Moses knew about these things
three thousand years ago? Certainly, the more we
study the matter, the more we must feel that this is
not to be supposed.</p>

<p>It is common, indeed, to explain much that seems
very wise in the law of Moses by referring to the fact
that he was a highly educated man, "instructed in all
the wisdom of the Egyptians." But it is just this fact of
his Egyptian education that makes it in the last degree
improbable that he should have derived the ideas of
this law from Egypt. Could he have taken his ideas
with regard, for instance, to defilement by the dead,
from a system of education which taught the contrary,
and which, so far from regarding those who had to do
with the dead as unclean, held them especially sacred?
And so with regard to the dietetic laws: these are not
the laws of Egypt; nor have we any evidence that
those were determined, like these Hebrew laws, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
such scientific facts as those to which we have referred.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
In this day, when, at last, men of all schools, and those
with most scientific knowledge, most of all, are joining
to extol the exact wisdom of this ancient law, a wisdom
which has no parallel in like laws among other nations,
is it not in place to press this question? Whence had
this man this unique wisdom, three thousand years in
advance of his times? There are many who will feel
compelled to answer, even as Holy Scripture answers;
even as Moses, according to the record, answers. The
secret of this wisdom will be found, not in the court
of Pharaoh, but in the holy tent of meeting; it is all
explained if we but assume that what is written in the
first verse of this chapter is true: "The Lord spake
unto Moses and unto Aaron."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>

<h3><em>OF THE UNCLEANNESS OF ISSUES.</em></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lev.</span> xv. 1-33.</p>


<p>Inasmuch as the law concerning defilement from
issues is presupposed and referred to in that concerning
the defilement of child-bearing, in chap. xii., it
will be well to consider this before the latter. For this
order there is the more reason, because, as will appear,
although the two sections are separated, in the present
arrangement of the book, by the law concerning defilement
by leprosy (xiii., xiv.), they both refer to the same
general topic, and are based upon the same moral
conceptions.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the law in chap. xv. is very
simple. Verses 2-18 deal with the cases of ceremonial
defilement by issues in men; vv. 19-30, with analogous
cases in women. The principle in both classes is one
and the same; the issue, whether normal or abnormal,
rendered the person affected unclean; only, when abnormal,
the defilement was regarded as more serious
than in other cases, not only in a physical, but also
in a ceremonial and legal aspect. In all such cases, in
addition to the washing with water which was always
required, it was commanded that on the eighth day
from the time of the cessation of the issue, the person
who had been so affected should come before the priest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
and present for his cleansing a sin-offering and a burnt-offering.</p>

<p>What now is the principle which underlies these
regulations?</p>

<p>In seeking the answer to this question, we at once
note the suggestive fact that this law concerning issues
takes cognisance only of such as are connected with
the sexual organisation. All others, however, in themselves,
from a merely physical point of view, equally unwholesome
or loathsome, are outside the purview of the
Mosaic code. They do not render the person affected,
according to the law, ceremonially unclean. It is therefore
evident that the lawgiver must have had before him
something other than merely the physical peculiarities
of these defilements, and that, for the true meaning of
this part of the law, we must look deeper than the
surface. It should also be observed here that this
characteristic of the law just mentioned, places the law
of issues under the same general category with the
law (chap. xii.) concerning the uncleanness of child-bearing,
as indeed the latter itself intimates (xii. 2).
The question thus arises: Why are these particular
cases, and such as these only, regarded as ceremonially
defiling?</p>

<p>To see the reason of this, we must recur to facts
which have already come before us. When our first
parents sinned, death was denounced against them as
the penalty of their sin. Such had been the threat:
"In the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt die."
The death denounced indeed affected the whole being,
the spiritual as well as the physical nature of man; but
it comprehended the death of the body, which thus
became, what it still is, the most impressive manifestation
of the presence of sin in every person who dies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
Hence, as we have seen, the law kept this connection
between sin and death steadily before the mind, in that
it constantly applied the principle that the dead defiles.
Not only so, but, for this reason, such things as tended
to bring death were also reckoned unclean; and thus
the regulations of the law concerning clean and unclean
meats, while strictly hygienic in character, were yet
grounded in this profound ethical fact of the connection
between sin and death; had man not sinned, nothing
in the world had been able to bring in death, and all
things had been clean. For the same reason, again,
leprosy, as exemplifying in a vivid and terrible way
disease as a progressive death, a living manifestation
of the presence of the curse of God, and therefore of
the presence of sin, a type of all disease, was regarded
as involving ceremonial defilement, and therefore as
requiring sacrificial cleansing.</p>

<p>But in the curse denounced upon our first parents
was yet more. It was specially taught that the curse
should affect the generative power of the race. For we
read (Gen. iii. 16): "Unto the woman He said, I will
greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in
sorrow thou shalt bring forth children." Whatever
these words may precisely mean, it is plain that they
are intended to teach that, because of sin, the curse of
God fell in some mysterious way upon the sexual organisation.
And although the woman only is specifically
mentioned, as being "first in the transgression," that
the curse fell also upon the same part of man's nature
is plain from the words in Gen. v. 3, where the long
mortuary record of the antediluvians is introduced by
the profoundly significant statement that Adam began
the long line, with its inheritance of death, by begetting
a son "in his own likeness, after his image." Fallen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
himself under the curse of death, physical and spiritual,
he therewith lost the capacity to beget a creature like
himself in his original state, in the image of God, and
could only be the means of bringing into the world a
creature who was an inheritor of physical weakness
and spiritual and bodily death.</p>

<p>In the light of this ancient record, which must have
been before the mind of the Hebrew lawgiver, we can
now see why the law concerning unclean issues should
have had special relation to that part of man's physical
organisation which has to do with the propagation of
the race. Just as death defiled, because it was a visible
representation of the presence of the curse of God, and
thus of sin, as the ground of the curse, even so was it
with all the issues specified in this law. They were
regarded as making a man unclean, because they were
manifestations of the curse in a part of man's nature
which, according to the Word of God, sin has specially
affected. For this reason they fell under the same
law as death. They separated the person thus affected
from the congregation, and excluded him from the public
worship of a holy God, as making him "unclean."</p>

<p>It is impossible now to miss the spiritual meaning of
these laws concerning issues of this class. In that
these alone, out of many others, which from a merely
physical point of view are equally offensive, were
taken under the cognisance of this law, the fact was
thereby symbolically emphasised that the fountain of
life in man is defiled. To be a sinner were bad enough,
if it only involved the voluntary and habitual practice
of sin. But this law of issues testifies to us, even now,
that, as God sees man's case, it is far worse than this.
The evil of sin is so deeply seated that it could lie no
deeper. The curse has in such manner fallen on our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
being, as that in man and woman the powers and
faculties which concern the propagation of their kind
have fallen under the blight. All that any son of Adam
can now do is to beget a son in his own physical and
moral image, an heir of death, and by nature unclean
and unholy. Sufficiently distasteful this truth is in all
ages; but in none perhaps ever more so than our own,
in which it has become a fundamental postulate of
much popular theology, and of popular politics as well,
that man is naturally not bad, but good, and, on the
whole, is doing as well as under the law of evolution,
and considering his environment, can reasonably be
expected. The spiritual principle which underlies the
law concerning defilement by issues, as also that concerning
the uncleanness of child-bearing, assumes the
exact opposite.</p>

<p>It is indeed true that similar causes of ceremonial
uncleanness have been recognised in ancient and in
modern times among many other peoples. But this is
no objection to the truth of the interpretation of the
Mosaic law here given. For in so far as there is
genuine agreement, the fact may rather confirm than
weaken the argument for this view of the case, as
showing that there is an ineradicable instinct in the
heart of man which connects all that directly or indirectly
has to do with the continuance of our race,
in a peculiar degree, with the ideas of uncleanness and
shame. And, on the other hand, the differences in
such cases from the Mosaic law show us just what
we should expect,&mdash;a degree of moral confusion and
a deadening of the moral sense among the heathen
nations, which is most significant. As has been justly
remarked, the Hindoo has one law on this subject
for the Brahman, another for others; the outcast for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
some deadly sin, often of a purely frivolous nature,
and a new-born child, are reckoned equally unclean.
Or,&mdash;to take the case of a people contemporary with
the Hebrews,&mdash;among the ancient Chaldeans, while
these same issues were accounted ceremonially defiling,
as in the law of Moses, with these were also reckoned
in the same category, as unclean, whatsoever was
separated from the body, even to the cuttings of the
hair and the parings of the nails. Evidently, we thus
have here, not likeness, but a profound and most suggestive
moral contrast between the Chaldean and the
Hebrew law. Of the profound ethical truth which
vitalises and gives deep significance to the law of
Moses, we find no trace in the other system. And it
is no wonder if, indeed, the one law is, as declared, a
revelation from the holy God, and the other the work
of sinful and sin-blinded man.</p>

<p>It is another moral lesson which is brought before
us in these laws that, as God looks at the matter, sin
pertains not only to action, but also to being. Not
only actions, from which we can abstain, but operations
of nature which we cannot help, alike defile; defile
in such a manner and degree as to require, even as
voluntary acts of sin, the cleansing of water, and the
expiatory blood of a sin-offering. One could not avoid
many of the defilements mentioned in this chapter, but
that made no difference; he was unclean. For the
lesser grades of uncleanness it sufficed that one be
purified by washing with water; and a sin-offering was
only required when this purification had been neglected;
but in all cases where the defilement assumed its
extreme form, the sin-offering and the burnt-offering
must be brought, and be offered for the unclean person
by the priest. So is it, we are taught, with that sin of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
nature which these cases symbolised; we cannot help
it, and yet the washing of regeneration and the cleansing
of the blood of Christ is required for its removal.
Very impressive in its teaching now becomes the
miracle in which our Lord healed the poor woman
afflicted with the issue of blood (Mark v. 25-34), for
which she had vainly sought cure. It was a case like
that covered by the law in chap. xv. 25-27; and he
who will read and consider the provisions of that law
will understand, as otherwise he could not, how great
her trial and how heavy her burden must have been.
He will wonder also, as never before, at the boldness
of her faith, who, although, according to the law, her
touch should defile the Lord, yet ventured to believe
that not only should this not be so, but that the healing
power which went forth from Him should neutralise
the defilement, and carry healing virtue to the very
centre of her life. Thus, if other miracles represent
our Lord as meeting the evil of sin in its various manifestations
in action, this miracle represents His healing
power as reaching to the very source and fountain of
life, where it is needed no less.</p>

<p>The law concerning the removal of these defilements,
after all that has preceded, will admit only of one
interpretation. The washing of water is the uniform
symbol of the cleansing of the soul from pollution by
the power of the Holy Ghost; the sacrifices point to
the sacrifice of Christ, in its twofold aspect as burnt-offering
and sin-offering, as required by and availing
for the removal of the sinful defilement which, in the
mind of God, attaches even to that in human nature
which is not under the control of the will. At the
same time, whereas in all these cases the sin-offering
prescribed is the smallest known to the law, it is symbolised,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
in full accord with the teaching of conscience,
that the gravity of the defilement, where there has not
been the active concurrence of the will, is less than
where the will has seconded nature. In all cases of
prolonged defilement from these sources, it was required
that the affected person should still be regarded as
unclean for seven days after the cessation of the
infirmity, and on the eighth day came the sacrificial
cleansing. The significance of the seven as the
covenant number, the number also wherein was completed
the old creation, has been already before us:
that of "the eighth" will best be considered in connection
with the provisions of chap. xii., to which we
next turn our attention.</p>

<p>The law of this chapter has a formal closing, in which
are used these words (ver. 31): "Thus shall ye separate
the children of Israel from their uncleanness; that
they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile My
tabernacle that is in the midst of them."</p>

<p>Of which the natural meaning is this, that the defilements
mentioned, as conspicuous signs of man's fallen
condition, were so offensive before a holy God, as apart
from these purifications to have called down the judgment
of death on those in whom they were found. In
these words lies also the deeper spiritual thought&mdash;if we
have rightly apprehended the symbolic import of these
regulations&mdash;that not only, as in former cases mentioned
under the law of offerings, do voluntary acts of sin
separate from God and if unatoned for call down His
judgment, but that even our infirmities and the involuntary
motions of sin in our nature have the same
effect, and, apart from the cleansing of the Holy Spirit
and the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, ensure the final
judgment of death.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>

<h3><em>THE UNCLEANNESS OF CHILD-BEARING.</em></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lev.</span> xii. 1-8.</p>


<p>The reference in xii. 2 to the regulations given in
xv. 19, as remarked in the preceding chapter,
shows us that the author of these laws regarded the
circumstances attending child-birth as falling under the
same general category, in a ceremonial and symbolic
aspect, as the law of issues. As a special case, however,
the law concerning child-birth presents some very
distinctive and instructive features.</p>

<p>The period during which the mother was regarded
as unclean, in the full comprehension of that term, was
seven days, as in the analogous case mentioned in
xv. 19, with the remarkable exception, that when she
had borne a daughter this period was doubled. At
the expiration of this period of seven days, her ceremonial
uncleanness was regarded as in so far lessened
that the restrictions affecting the ordinary relations of
life, as ordered, xv. 19-23, were removed. She was
not, however, yet allowed to touch any hallowed thing
or to come into the sanctuary, until she had fulfilled,
from the time of the birth of the child, if a son, forty
days; if a daughter, twice forty, or eighty days. At
the expiration of the longer period, she was to bring,
as in the law concerning the prolonged issue of blood
(xv. 25-30), a burnt-offering and a sin-offering unto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
the door of the tent of meeting, wherewith the priest
was to make an atonement for her; when first she
should be accounted clean, and restored to full covenant
privileges. The only difference from the similar
law in chap. xv. is in regard to the burnt-offering commanded,
which was larger and more costly,&mdash;a lamb,
instead of a turtle dove, or a young pigeon. Still, in
the same spirit of gracious accommodation to the poor
which was illustrated in the general law of the sin-offering,
it was ordered (ver. 8.): "If her means suffice
not for a lamb, then she shall take two turtledoves, or
two young pigeons; the one for a burnt offering, and
the other for a sin offering." The law then applied,
according to xv. 29, 30. A gracious provision this
was, as all will remember, of which the mother of our
Lord availed herself (Luke ii. 22-24), as being one of
those who were too poor to bring a lamb for a burnt-offering.</p>

<p>To the meaning of these regulations, the key is
found in the same conceptions which we have seen to
underlie the law concerning issues. In the birth of
a child, the special original curse against the woman
is regarded by the law as reaching its fullest, most consummate
and significant expression. For the extreme
evil of the state of sin into which the first woman, by
that first sin, brought all womanhood, is seen most of
all in this, that now woman, by means of those powers
given her for good and blessing, can bring into the
world only a child of sin. And it is, apparently,
because we here see the operation of this curse in its
most conspicuous form, that the time of her enforced
separation from the tabernacle worship is prolonged to
a period of forty or eighty days.</p>

<p>It has been usual to speak of the time of the mother's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
uncleanness, and subsequent continued exclusion from
the tabernacle worship, as being doubled in the case
of the birth of a daughter; but it were, perhaps, more
accurate to regard the normal length of these periods as
being respectively fourteen and eighty days, of which
the former is double of that required in xv. 28. This
normal period would then be more properly regarded
as shortened by one half in the case of a male child, in
virtue of his circumcision on the eighth day.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Ordinance of Circumcision.</span></p>

<p class="center">xii. 3.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised."</p></blockquote>

<p>Although the rite of circumcision here receives a new
and special sanction, it had been appointed long before
by God as the sign of His covenant with Abraham
(Gen. xvii. 10-14). Nor was circumcision, probably,
even then a new thing. That the ancient Egyptians
practised it is well known; so also did the Arabs and
Ph&oelig;nicians; in fact, the custom has been very extensively
observed, not only by nations with whom the
Israelites came in contact, but by others who have not
had, in historic times, connection with any civilised
peoples; as, for example, the Congo negroes, and certain
Indian tribes in South America.</p>

<p>The fundamental idea connected with circumcision,
by most of the peoples who have practised it, appears
to have been physical purification; indeed, the Arabs
call it by the name <em>tatur</em>, which has this precise meaning.
And it deserves to be noticed that for this idea
regarding circumcision there is so much reason in fact,
that high medical authorities have attributed to it a real
hygienic value, especially in warm climates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>No one need feel any difficulty in supposing that
this common conception attached to the rite also in the
minds of the Hebrews. Rather all the more fitting
it was, if there was a basis in fact for this familiar
opinion, that God should thus have taken a ceremony
already known to the surrounding peoples, and in itself
of a wholesome physical effect, and constituted it for
Abraham and his seed a symbol of an analogous
spiritual fact; namely, the purification of sin at its
fountain-head, the cleansing of the evil nature with
which we all are born. It should be plain enough that
it makes nothing against this as the true interpretation
of the rite, even if that be granted which some have
claimed, that it has had, in some instances, a connection
with the phallic worship so common in the East, or
that it has been regarded by some as a sacrificial
ceremony. Only the more noteworthy would it thus
appear that the Hebrews should have held strictly to
that view of its significance which had a solid basis in
physical fact,&mdash;a fact, moreover, which made it a peculiarly
fitting symbol of the spiritual grace which the
Biblical writers connect with it. For that it was so
regarded by them will not be disputed. In this very
book (xxvi. 41) we read of an "uncircumcised heart;"
as also in Deuteronomy, the prophecies of Jeremiah
and Ezekiel, and other books of Scripture.</p>

<p>All this, as intimating the signification of circumcision
as here enjoined, is further established by the New
Testament references. Of these the most formal is
perhaps that in Col. ii. 10, 11, where we read that
believers in Christ, in virtue of their union with Him
in whom the unclean nature has been made clean, are
said to be "circumcised with a circumcision not made
with hands, in the putting off of the body of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
flesh, in the circumcision of Christ;" so that Paul elsewhere
writes to the Philippians (iii. 3): "We are the
circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God, and
glory in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the
flesh."</p>

<p>And that God, in selecting this ancient rite to be the
sign of His covenant in the flesh of Abraham and his
seed (Gen. xvii. 13), had regard to the deep spiritual
meaning which it could so naturally carry is explicitly
declared by the Apostle Paul (Rom. iv. 11), who tells
us that this sign of circumcision was "a seal of the
righteousness of faith," even the righteousness and
the faith concerning which, in the previous context, he
was arguing; and which are still, for all men, the one,
the ground, and the other, the condition, of salvation.
It is truly strange that, in the presence of these plain
words of the Apostle, any should still cling to the idea
that circumcision had reference only to the covenant
with Israel as a nation, and not, above all, to this
profound spiritual truth which is basal to salvation,
whether for the Jew or for the Gentile.</p>

<p>And so, when the Hebrew infant was circumcised, it
signified for him and for his parents these spiritual
realities. It was an outward sign and seal of the
covenant of God with Abraham and with his seed, to
be a God to him and to his seed after him; and it
signified further that this covenant of God was to be
carried out and made effectual only through the putting
away of the flesh, the corrupt nature with which we are
born, and of all that belongs to it, in order that, thus
circumcised with the circumcision of the heart, every
child of Abraham might indeed be an Israelite in whom
there should be no guile.</p>

<p>And the law commands, in accord with the original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
command to Abraham, that the circumcision should
take place on the eighth day. This is the more noticeable,
that among other nations which practised, or still
practise, the rite, the time is different. The Egyptians,
for example, circumcised their sons between the sixth
and tenth years, and the modern Mohammedans between
the twelfth and fourteenth year. What is the
significance of this eighth day?</p>

<p>In the first place, it is easy to see that we have
in this direction a provision of God's mercy; for if
delayed beyond infancy or early childhood, as among
many other peoples, the operation is much more serious,
and may even involve some danger; while in so early
infancy it is comparatively trifling, and attended with
no risk.</p>

<p>Further, by the administration of circumcision at the
very opening of life, it is suggested that in the Divine
ideal the grace which was signified thereby, of the
cleansing of nature, was to be bestowed upon the child,
not first at a late period of life, but from its very
beginning, thus anticipating the earliest awakening of
the principle of inborn sin. It was thus signified that
before ever the child knew, or could know, the grace
that was seeking to save him, he was to be taken into
covenant relation with God. So even under the strange
form of this ordinance we discover the same mind
that was in Him who said concerning infant children
(Luke xviii. 16): "Suffer the little children to come unto
Me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom
of God." Thus we may well recollect, in passing,
that, although the law has passed away in the Levitical
form, the mind of the Lawgiver concerning the little
children of His people, is still the same.</p>

<p>But the question still remains, Why was the eighth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
day selected, and not rather, for instance, the sixth or
the seventh, which would have no less perfectly represented
these ideas? The answer is to be found in the
symbolic significance of the eighth day. As the old
creation was completed in six days, with a following
Sabbath of rest, so that six is ever the number of the
old creation, as under imperfection and sin; the eighth
day, which is the first day of a new week, everywhere
in Scripture appears as the number symbolic of the
new creation, in which all things shall be restored in
the great redemption through the Second Adam. The
thought finds its fullest expression in the resurrection
of Christ, as the First-born from the dead, the Beginning
and the Lord of the new creation, who in His
resurrection-body manifested the first-fruits in physical
life of the new creation, rising from the dead on the
first, or, in other words, the day after the seventh, the
eighth day. This gives the key to the use of the
number eight in the Mosaic symbolism. Thus in the
law of the cleansing of the man or the woman that had
an issue, the sacrifices which effectuated their formal
deliverance from the curse under which, through the
weakness of their old nature, they had suffered, were
to be offered on the eighth day (xv. 14, 29); the
priestly cleansing of the leper from the taint of his living
death was also effected on the eighth day (xiv. 10);
so also the cleansing of the Nazarite who had been
defiled by the dead (Numb. vi. 10). So also the holy
convocation which closed the feast of tabernacles or ingathering&mdash;the
feast which, as we shall see, typically
prefigured the great harvest of which Christ was the
First-fruits&mdash;was ordained, in like manner, for the eighth
day (xxiii. 36). With good reason, then, was circumcision
ordered for the eighth day, seeing that what it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
symbolically signified was precisely this: the putting
off of the flesh with which we are born through the
circumcision of Christ, and therewith the first beginning
of a new and purified nature&mdash;a change so profound
and radical, and in which the Divine efficiency is so
immediately concerned, that Paul said of it that if any
man was in Christ, in whose circumcision we are circised
(Col. ii. 11), "there is a new creation" (2 Cor.
v. 17, margin, R.V.).</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Purification after Child-birth.</span></p>

<p class="center">xii. 4-8.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And she shall continue in the blood of her purifying three and
thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the
sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled. But if she bear
a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her impurity:
and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying threescore and
six days. And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son,
or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt
offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering, unto
the door of the tent of meeting, unto the priest: and he shall offer
it before the Lord, and make atonement for her; and she shall be
cleansed from the fountain of her blood. This is the law for her that
beareth, whether a male or a female. And if her means suffice not
for a lamb, then she shall take two turtledoves, or two young pigeons;
the one for a burnt offering, and the other for a sin offering: and the
priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be clean."</p></blockquote>

<p>Until the circumcision of the new-born child, on the
eighth day, he was regarded by the law as ceremonially
still in a state of nature, and therefore as symbolically
unclean. For this reason, again, the mother who had
brought him into the world, and whose life was so
intimately connected with his life, was regarded as
unclean also. Unclean, under analogous circumstances,
according to the law of xv. 19, she was reckoned
doubly unclean in this case,&mdash;unclean because of her
issue, and unclean because of her connection with this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
child, uncircumcised and unclean. But when the symbolic
cleansing of the child took place by the ordinance
of circumcision, then her uncleanness, so far as occasioned
by her immediate relation to him, came to an
end. She was not indeed completely restored; for,
according to the law, in her still continuing condition,
it was impossible that she should be allowed to come
into the tabernacle of the Lord, or touch any hallowed
thing; but the ordinance which admitted her child,
admitted her also again to the fellowship of the covenant
people.</p>

<p>The longer period of forty&mdash;or, in the case of the
birth of a female child, of twice forty&mdash;days must also
be explained upon symbolical grounds. Some have
indeed attempted to account for these periods, as also
for the difference in their length in the two cases, by
a reference to beliefs of the ancients with regard to the
physical condition of the mother during these periods;
but such notions of the ancients are not justified by
facts; nor, especially, would they by any means account
for the greatly prolonged period of eighty days in the
case of the female child. It is possible that in the
forty, and twice forty, we may have a reference to
the forty weeks during which the life of the unborn
child had been identified with that of the mother,&mdash;a
child which, it must be remembered, according to the
uniform Biblical view, was not innocent, but conceived
in sin; for each week of which connection of life, the
mother suffered a judicial exclusion of one, or, in the
case of the birth of a daughter, of two days; the time
being doubled in the latter case with allusion to the
double curse which, according to Genesis, rested upon
the woman, as "first in the transgression." But, apart
from this, however difficult it may be to give a satisfactory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
explanation of the fact, it is certain that throughout
Scripture the number forty appears to have a
symbolic meaning; and one can usually trace in its
application a reference, more or less distinct, to the
conception of trial or testing. Thus for forty days was
Moses in the mount,&mdash;a time of testing for Israel, as
for him: forty days, the spies explored the promised
land; forty years, Israel was tried in the wilderness;
forty days, abode Elijah in the wilderness; forty days,
also, was our Lord fasting in the wilderness; and forty
days, again, He abode in resurrection life upon the
earth.</p>

<p>The forty (or eighty) days ended, the mother was
now formally reinstated in the fulness of her privileges
as a daughter of Israel. The ceremonial, as in the
law of issues, consisted in the presentation of a burnt-offering
and a sin-offering, with the only variation
that, wherever possible, the burnt-offering must be a
young lamb, instead of a dove or pigeon; the reason
for which variation is to be found either in the fact
that the burnt-offering was to represent not herself
alone, but also her child, or, possibly, as some have
suggested, it was because she had been so much longer
excluded from the tabernacle service than in the other
case.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The teaching of this law, then, is twofold: it concerns,
first, the woman; and, secondly, the child which she
bears. As regards the woman, it emphasises the fact
that, because "first in the trangression," she is under
special pains and penalties in virtue of her sex. The
capacity of motherhood, which is her crown and her glory,
though still a precious privilege, has yet been made,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
because of sin, an inevitable instrument of pain, and
that because of her relation to the first sin. We are
thus reminded that the specific curse denounced against
the woman, as recorded in the book of Genesis, is no
dead letter, but a fact. No doubt, the conception is one
which raises difficulties which in themselves are great,
and to modern thought are greater than ever. Nevertheless,
the fact abides unaltered, that even to this day
woman is under special pains and disabilities, inseparably
connected with her power of motherhood. Modern
theorists, men and women with nineteenth-century
notions concerning politics and education, may persist
in ignoring this; but the fact abides, and cannot be got
rid of by passing resolutions in a mass-meeting, or even
by Act of Parliament or Congress.</p>

<p>And so, as it is useless to object to facts, it is only
left to object to the Mosaic view of the facts, which
connects them with sin, and, in particular, with the first
sin. Why should all the daughters of Eve suffer because
of her sin? Where is the justice in such an ordinance?
A question this is to which we cannot yet give any
satisfactory answer. But it does not follow that because
in any proposition there are difficulties which at present
we are unable to solve, therefore the proposition is false.
And, further, it is important to observe that this law,
under which womanhood abides, is after all only a
special case under that law of the Divine government
which is announced in the second commandment, by
which the iniquities of the fathers are visited upon
the children. It is most certainly a law which, to
our apprehension, suggests great moral difficulties,
even to the most reverent spirits; but it is no less
certainly a law which represents a conspicuous and
tremendous fact, which is illustrated, for instance, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
family of every drunkard in the world. And it is well
worth observing, that while the ceremonial law, which
was specially intended to keep this fact before the mind
and the conscience, is abrogated, the fact that woman is
still under certain Divinely imposed disabilities because
of that first sin, is reaffirmed in the New Testament,
and is by apostolic authority applied in the administration
of Church government. For Paul wrote to Timothy
(1 Tim. ii. 12, 13): "I permit not a woman to teach,
nor to have dominion over a man.... For Adam was
not beguiled, but the woman being beguiled hath fallen
into transgression." Modern theorists, and so-called
"reformers" in Church, State, and society, busy with
their social, governmental, and ecclesiastical novelties,
would do well to heed this apostolic reminder.</p>

<p>All the more beautiful, as against this dark background
of mystery, is the word of the Apostle which
follows, wherein he reminds us that, through the grace
of God, even by means of those very powers of motherhood
on which the curse has so heavily fallen, has come
the redemption of the woman; so that "she shall be
saved through the childbearing, if they continue in
faith and love and sanctification with sobriety"
(1 Tim. ii. 15, R.V.); seeing that "in Christ Jesus,"
in respect of the completeness and freeness of salvation,
"there can be no male and female" (Gal. iii. 28, R.V.).</p>

<p>But, in the second place, we may also derive abiding
instruction from this law, concerning the child which is
of man begotten and of woman born. It teaches us
that not only has the curse thus fallen on the woman,
but that, because she is herself a sinful creature, she
can only bring forth another sinful creature like herself;
and if a daughter, then a daughter inheriting all her
own peculiar infirmities and disabilities. The law, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
regards both mother and child, expresses in the language
of symbolism those words of David in his penitential
confession (Psalm li. 5): "Behold, I was shapen in
iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me."
Men may contemptuously call this "theology," or even
rail at it as "Calvinism;" but it is more than theology,
more than Calvinism; it is a <em>fact</em>, to which until this
present time history has seen but one exception, even
that mysterious Son of the Virgin, who claimed, however,
to be no mere man, but the Christ, the Son of
the Blessed!</p>

<p>And yet many, who surely can think but superficially
upon the solemn facts of life, still object to this most
strenuously, that even the new-born child should be
regarded as in nature sinful and unclean. Difficulty
here we must all admit,&mdash;difficulty so great that it is
hard to overstate it&mdash;regarding the bearing of this fact
on the character of the holy and merciful God, who
in the beginning made man. And yet, surely, deeper
thought must confess that herein the Mosaic view
of infant nature&mdash;a view which is assumed and taught
throughout Holy Scripture&mdash;however humbling to our
natural pride, is only in strictest accord with what
the admitted principles of the most exact science
compel us to admit. For whenever, in any case, we
find all creatures of the same class doing, under all
circumstances, any one thing, we conclude that the
reason for this can only lie in the nature of such
creatures, antecedent to any influence of a tendency
to imitation. If, for instance, the ox everywhere and
always eats the green thing of the earth, and not flesh,
the reason, we say, is found simply in the nature of the
ox as he comes into being. So when we see all men,
everywhere, under all circumstances, as soon as ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
they come to the time of free moral choice, always
choosing and committing sin, what can we conclude&mdash;regarding
this, not as a theological, but merely as a
scientific question&mdash;but that man, as he comes into the
world, must have a sinful nature? And this being so,
then why must not the law of heredity apply, according
to which, by a law which knows of no exceptions,
like ever produces its like?</p>

<p>Least of all, then, should those object to the view of
child-nature which is represented in this law of Leviticus,
who accept these commonplaces of modern science as
representing facts. Wiser it were to turn attention to
the other teaching of the law, that, notwithstanding
these sad and humiliating facts, there is provision made
by God, through the cleansing by grace of the very nature
in which we are born, and atonement for the sin which
without our fault we inherit, for a complete redemption
from all the inherited corruption and guilt.</p>

<p>And, last of all, especially should Christian parents
with joy and thankfulness receive the manifest teaching
of this law,&mdash;teaching reaffirmed by our blessed Lord in
the New Testament,&mdash;that God our Father offers to
parental faith Himself to take in hand our children, even
from the earliest beginning of their infant days, and,
purifying the fountain of their life through "a circumcision
made without hands," receive the little ones into
covenant relation with Himself, to their eternal salvation.
And thus is the word of the Apostle fulfilled: "Where
sin abounded, grace did abound more exceedingly:
that, as sin reigned in death, even so might grace reign
through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus
Christ our Lord."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h2>

<h3><em>THE UNCLEANNESS OF LEPROSY.</em></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lev.</span> xiii. 1-46.</p>


<p>The interpretation of this chapter presents no little
difficulty. The description of the diseases with
which the law here deals is not given in a scientific form;
the point of view, as the purpose of all, is strictly
practical. As for the Hebrew word rendered "leprosy,"
it does not itself give any light as to the nature of the
disease thus designated. The word simply means "a
stroke," as also does the generic term used in ver. 2
and elsewhere, and translated "plague." Inasmuch
as the Septuagint translators rendered the former
term by the Greek word "<i lang="gr" xml:lang="gr">lepra</i>" (whence our word
"leprosy"), and as, it is said, the old Greek physicians
comprehended under that term only such scaly
cutaneous eruptions as are now known as <em>psoriasis</em>
(<em>vulg.</em>, "salt-rheum"), and for what is now known as
leprosy reserved the term "elephantiasis,"<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> it has
been therefore urged by high authority that in these
chapters is no reference to the leprosy of modern
speech, but only to some disease or diseases much less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
serious, either psoriasis or some other, consisting, like
that, of a scaly eruption on the skin.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> To the above
argument it is also added that the signs which are
given for the recognition of the disease intended, are
not such as we should expect if it were the modern
leprosy; as, for example, there is no mention of the
insensibility of the skin, which is so characteristic a
feature of the disease, at least, in a very common
variety; moreover, we find in this chapter no allusion
to the hideous mutilation which so commonly results
from leprosy.</p>

<p>When the use of the Hebrew term rendered
"leprosy" is examined, in this law and elsewhere, it
certainly seems to be used with great definiteness to
describe a disease which had as a very characteristic
feature a whitening of the skin throughout, together
with other marks common to the early stages of leprosy
as given in this chapter. Only in ver. 12 does the
Hebrew word appear to be applied to a disease of a
different character, though also marked by the whitening
of the skin. As for the symptoms indicated, the
undoubted absence of many conspicuous marks of
leprosy may be accounted for by the following considerations.
In the first place, with a single exception
(vv. 9-11), the earliest stages of the disease are
described; and, secondly, it may reasonably be assumed
that, through the desire to ensure the earliest possible
separation of a leprous man from the congregation, signs
were to be noted and acted upon, which might also be
found in other forms of skin disease. The aim of the
law is that, if possible, the man shall be removed from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
the camp before the disease has assumed its most
unambiguous and revolting form. As for the omission
to mention the insensibility of the skin of the leper,
this seems to be sufficiently explained when we remember
that this symptom is characteristic of only one,
and that not the most fatal, variety of the disease.</p>

<p>But, it has also been urged, that elsewhere in the
Scripture the so-called lepers appear as mingling with
other people&mdash;as, for example, in the case of Naaman
and Gehazi&mdash;in a way which shows that the disease
was not regarded as contagious; whence it is inferred,
again, that the leprosy of which we read in the Bible
cannot be the same with the disease which is so called
in our time. But, in reply to this objection, it may be
answered that even modern medical opinion has been
by no means as confident of the contagiousness of the
disease&mdash;at least, until quite recently&mdash;as were people
in the middle ages; nor, moreover, can we assume that
the prevention of contagion must have been the chief
reason for the segregation of the leper, according to the
Levitical law, seeing that a like separation was enjoined
in many other cases of ceremonial uncleanness
where any thought of contagion or infection was quite
impossible.</p>

<p>In further support of the more common opinion,
which identifies the disease chiefly referred to in this
chapter with the leprosy of modern times, the following
considerations appear to be of no little weight. In the
first place, the words themselves which are applied to
the disease in these chapters and elsewhere,&mdash;<i>tsara'ath</i>
and <i>nega'</i>, both meaning, etymologically, "a stroke,"
<em>i.e.</em>, a stroke in some eminent sense,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>&mdash;while peculiarly
fitting if the disease be that which we now know as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
leprosy, seem very strangely chosen if, as Sir Risdon
Bennett thinks, they only designate varieties of a disease
of so little seriousness as <i>psoriasis</i>. Then, again, the
words used by Aaron to Moses (Numb. xii. 12), referring
to the leprosy of Miriam, deserve great weight
here: "Let her not, I pray, be as one dead, of whom
the flesh is half consumed." These words sufficiently
answer the allegation that there is no certain reference
in Scripture to the mutilation which is so characteristic
of the later stages of the disease. It would not be easy
to describe in more accurate language the condition of
the leper as the plague advances; while, on the other
hand, if the leprosy of the Bible be only such a light
affection as "salt-rheum," these words and the evident
horror which they express, are so exaggerated as to be
quite unaccountable.</p>

<p>Then, again, we cannot lose sight of the place which
the disease known in Scripture language as leprosy
holds in the sight of the law. As a matter of fact, it is
singled out from a multitude of diseases as the object
of the most stringent and severe regulations, and the
most elaborate ceremonial, known to the law. Now, if
the disease intended be indeed the awful <i lang="gr" xml:lang="gr">elephantiasis
Græcorum</i> of modern medical science, popularly known
as leprosy, this is most natural and reasonable; but if,
on the other hand, only some such non-malignant
disease as <em>psoriasis</em> be intended, this fact is inexplicable.
Further, the tenour of all references to the disease in
the Scripture implies that it was deemed so incurable
that its removal in any case was regarded as a
special sign of the exercise of Divine power. The
reference of the Hebrew maid of Naaman to the
prophet of God (2 Kings v. 3), as one who could cure
him, instead of proving that it was thought curable&mdash;as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
has been strangely urged&mdash;by ordinary means,
surely proves the exact opposite. Naaman, no doubt,
had exhausted medical resources; and the hope of the
maid for him is not based on the medical skill of
Elisha, but on the fact that he was a prophet of God,
and therefore able to draw on Divine power. To the
same effect is the word of the King of Israel, when he
received the letter of Naaman (2 Kings v. 7): "Am I
God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send
unto me to recover a man of his leprosy?" In full
accord with this is the appeal of our Lord (Matt. xi. 5)
to His cleansing of the lepers, as a sign of His
Messiahship which He ranks for convincing power
along with the raising of the dead.</p>

<p>Nor is it a fatal objection to the usual understanding
of this matter, that because the Levitical law prescribes
a ritual for the ceremonial cleansing of the leper
in case of his cure, therefore the disease so called
could not be one of the gravity and supposed incurability
of the true leprosy. For it is to be noted, in the
first place, that there is no intimation that recovery
from the leprosy was a common occurrence, or even
that it was to be expected at all, apart from the direct
power of God; and, in the second place, that the
Scriptural narrative represents God as now and then&mdash;though
very rarely&mdash;interposing for the cure of the
leper. And it may perhaps be added, that while a
recent authority writes, and with truth, that "medical
skill appears to have been more completely foiled by
this than by any other malady," it is yet remarked that,
when of the anæsthetic variety, "some spontaneous
cures are recorded."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The chapter before us calls for little detailed exposition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
The diagnosis of the disease by the priest is
treated under four different heads: (1) the case of a
leprosy rising spontaneously (vv. 1-17, 38, 39); (2)
leprosy rising out of a boil (vv. 18-24); (3) rising out
of a burn (vv. 24-28); (4) leprosy on the head or
beard (vv. 29-37, 40-44). The indications which are
to be noted are described (vv. 2, 3, 24-27, etc.) as a
rising of the surface, a scab (or scale), or a bright spot
(very characteristic), the presence in the spot of hair
turned white, the disease apparently deeper than the
outer or scarf skin, a reddish-white colour of the surface,
and a tendency to spread. The presence of
"raw flesh" is mentioned (ver. 10) as an indication of a
leprosy already somewhat advanced, "an old leprosy."
In cases of doubt, the suspected case is to be isolated
for a period of seven or, if need be, fourteen days, at
the expiration of which the priest's verdict is to be
given, as the symptoms may then indicate.</p>

<p>Two cases are mentioned which the priest is not to
regard as leprosy. The first (vv. 12, 13) is that in
which the plague "covers all the skin of him that hath
the plagues from his head even to his feet, as far as
appeareth to the priest," so that he "is all turned
white." At first thought, this seems quite unaccountable,
seeing that leprosy finally affects the whole
body. But the solution of the difficulty is not far to
seek. For the next verse provides that, in such a
case, if "raw flesh" appear, he shall be held to be
unclean. The explanation of this provision of ver. 12
is therefore apparently this: that if an eruption had so
spread as to cover the whole body, turning it white,
and yet no raw flesh had appeared in any place, the
disease could not be true leprosy; as, if it were, then,
by the time that it had so extended, "raw flesh" would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
certainly have appeared somewhere. The disease indicated
by this exception was indeed well known to
the ancients, as it is also to the moderns as the "dry
tetter;" which, although an affection often of long
duration, frequently disappears spontaneously, and is
never malignant.</p>

<p>The second case which is specified as not to be
mistaken for leprosy is mentioned in vv. 38, 39, where
it is described as marked by bright spots of a dull
whiteness, but without the white hair, and other
characteristic signs of leprosy. The Hebrew word by
which it is designated is rendered in the Revised
Version "tetter;" and the disease, a non-malignant
tetter or <em>eczema</em>, is still known in the East under the
same name (<em>bohak</em>) which is here used.</p>

<p>Verses 45, 46, give the law for him who has been by
the priest adjudged to be a leper. He must go with
clothes rent, with his hair neglected, his lip covered,
crying, "Unclean! unclean!" without the camp, and
there abide alone for so long as he continues to be
afflicted with the disease. In other words, he is to
assume all the ordinary signs of mourning for the
dead; he is to regard himself, and all others are to
regard him, as a dead man. As it were, he is a continual
mourner at his own funeral.</p>

<p>Wherein lay the reason for this law? One might
answer, in general, that the extreme loathsomeness of
the disease, which made the presence of those who had
it to be abhorrent even to their nearest friends, would
of itself make it only fitting, however distressing might
be the necessity, that such persons should be excluded
from every possibility of appearing, in their revolting
corruption, in the sacred and pure precincts of the
tabernacle of the holy God, as also from mingling with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
His people. Many, however, have seen in the regulation
only a wise law of public hygiene. That a
sanitary intent may very probably have been included
in the purpose of this law, we are by no means
inclined to deny. In earlier times, and all through
the middle ages, the disease was regarded as contagious;
and lepers were accordingly segregated,
as far as practicable, from the people. In modern
times, the weight of opinion until recent years has
been against this older view; but the tendency of
medical authority now appears to be to reaffirm the
older belief. The alarming increase of this horrible
disease in all parts of the world, of late, following
upon a general relaxation of those precautions against
contagion which were formerly thought necessary,
certainly supports this judgment; and it may thus be
easily believed that there was just sanitary ground for
the rigid regulations of the Mosaic code. And just
here it may be remarked, that if indeed there be any
degree of contagiousness, however small, in this
plague, no one who has ever seen the disease, or
understands anything of its incomparable horror and
loathsomeness, will feel that there is any force in the
objections which have been taken to this part of the
Mosaic law as of inhuman harshness toward the
sufferers. Even were the risk of contagion but small,
as it probably is, still, so terrible is the disease that
one would more justly say that the only inhumanity
were to allow those afflicted with it unrestricted intercourse
with their fellow-men. The truth is, that the
Mosaic law concerning the treatment of the leper,
when compared with regulations touching lepers which
have prevailed among other nations, stands contrasted
with them by its comparative leniency. The Hindoo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
law, as is well known, even insists that the leper ought
to put himself out of existence, requiring that he shall
be buried alive.</p>

<p>But if there be included in these regulations a
sanitary intent, this certainly does not exhaust their
significance. Rather, if this be admitted, it only
furnishes the basis, as in the case of the laws concerning
clean and unclean meats, for still more profound
spiritual teaching. For, as remarked before, it
is one of the fundamental thoughts of the Mosaic law,
that death, as being the extreme visible manifestation
of the presence of sin in the race, and a sign of the
consequent holy wrath of God against sinful man, is
inseparably connected with legal uncleanness. But all
disease is a forerunner of death, an incipient dying;
and is thus, no less really than actual death, a visible
manifestation of the presence and power of sin working
in the body through death. And yet it is easy to see
that it would have been quite impracticable to carry
out a law that therefore all disease should render
the sick person ceremonially unclean; while, on the
other hand, it was of consequence that Israel, and we
as well, should be kept in remembrance of this connection
between sin and disease, as death beginning.
What could have been more fitting, then, than this, that
the one disease which, without exaggeration, is of all
diseases the most loathsome, which is most manifestly
a visible representation of that which is in a measure
true of all disease, that it is death working in life,
that disease which is, not in a merely rhetorical sense,
but in fact, a living image of death,&mdash;should be selected
from all others for the illustration of this principle: to
be to Israel and to us, a visible, perpetual, and very
awful parable of the nature and the working of sin?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>And this is precisely what has been done. This
explains, as sanitary considerations alone do not, not
merely the separation of the leper from the holy people,
but also the solemn symbolism which required him to
assume the appearance of one mourning for the dead;
as also the symbolism of his cleansing, which, in like
manner, corresponded very closely with that of the
ritual of cleansing from defilement by the dead.
Hence, while all sickness, in a general way, is regarded
in the Holy Scriptures as a fitting symbol of sin, it has
always been recognised that, among all diseases, leprosy
is this in an exceptional and pre-eminent sense. This
thought seems to have been in the mind of David,
when, after his murder of Uriah and adultery with
Bathsheba, bewailing his iniquity (Psalm li. 7), he prayed,
"Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean." For
the only use of the hyssop in the law, which could be
alluded to in these words, is that which is enjoined
(xiv. 4-7) in the law for the cleansing of the leper, by
the sprinkling of the man to be cleansed with blood
and water with a hyssop branch.</p>

<p>And thus we find that, again, this elaborate ceremonial
contains, not merely an instructive lesson in
public sanitation, and practical suggestions in hygiene
for our modern times; but also lessons, far more profound
and momentous, concerning that spiritual malady
with which the whole human race is burdened,&mdash;lessons
therefore of the gravest personal consequence for every
one of us.</p>

<p>From among all diseases, leprosy has been selected
by the Holy Ghost to stand in the law as the supreme
type of sin, as seen by God! This is the very solemn fact
which is brought before us in this chapter. Let us well
consider it, and see that we receive the lesson, however<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
humiliating and painful, in the spirit of meekness and
penitence. Let us so study it that we shall with great
earnestness and true faith resort to the true and
heavenly High Priest, who alone can cleanse us of this
sore malady. And in order to do this, we must carefully
consider what is involved in this type.</p>

<p>In the first place, leprosy is undoubtedly selected to
be a special type of sin, on account of its extreme <em>loathsomeness</em>.
Beginning, indeed, as an insignificant spot,
"a bright place," a mere scale on the skin, it goes on
spreading, progressing ever from worse to worse, till at
last limb drops from limb, and only the hideous mutilated
remnant of what was once a man is left. A vivid
picture of the horrible reality has been given by that
veteran missionary and very accurate observer, the Rev.
William Thomson, D.D., who writes thus: "As I was
approaching Jerusalem, I was startled by the sudden
apparition of a crowd of beggars, sans eyes, sans nose,
sans hair, sans everything.... They held up their
handless arms, unearthly sounds gurgled through throats
without palates,&mdash;in a word, I was horrified."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Too
horrible is this to be repeated or thought of? Yes!
But then all the more solemnly instructive is it that the
Holy Spirit should have chosen this disease, the most
loathsome of all, as the most fatal of all, to symbolise
to us the true nature of that spiritual malady which
affects us all, as it is seen by the omniscient and most
holy God.</p>

<p>But it will very naturally be rejoined by some;
Surely it were gross exaggeration to apply this horrible
symbolism to the case of many who, although indeed
sinners, unbelievers also in Christ, yet certainly exhibit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
truly lovely and attractive characters. That this is
true regarding many who, according to the Scriptures,
are yet unsaved, cannot be denied. We read of one
such in the Gospel,&mdash;a young man, unsaved, who yet
was such that "Jesus looking upon him loved him"
(Mark x. 21). But this fact only makes the leprosy
the more fitting symbol of sin. For another characteristic
of the disease is its <em>insignificant and often even
imperceptible beginning</em>. We are told that in the case of
those who inherit the taint, it frequently remains quite
dormant in early life, only gradually appearing in later
years. How perfectly the type, in this respect, then,
symbolises sin! And surely any thoughtful man will
confess that this fact makes the presence of the infection
not less alarming, but more so. No comfort then
can be rightly had from any complacent comparison of
our own characters with those of many, perhaps professing
more, who are much worse than we, as the
manner of some is. No one who knew that from his
parents he had inherited the leprous taint, or in whom
the leprosy as yet appeared as only an insignificant
bright spot, would comfort himself greatly by the
observation that other lepers were much worse; and
that he was, as yet, fair and goodly to look upon.
Though the leprosy were in him but just begun, that
would be enough to fill him with dismay and consternation.
So should it be with regard to sin.</p>

<p>And it would so affect such a man the more surely,
when he knew that the disease, however slight in its beginnings,
was certainly <em>progressive</em>. This is one of the
unfailing marks of the disease. It may progress slowly,
but it progresses surely. To quote again the vivid
and truthful description of the above-named writer,
"It comes on by degrees in different parts of the body:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
the hair falls from the head and eyebrows; the nails
loosen, decay, and drop off; joint after joint of the
fingers and toes shrinks up and slowly falls away; the
gums are absorbed, and the teeth disappear; the nose,
the eyes, the tongue, and the palate are slowly consumed;
and, finally, the wretched victim sinks into
the earth and disappears."</p>

<p>In this respect again the fitness of the disease to
stand as an eminent type of sin is undeniable. No
man can morally stand still. No one has ever retained
the innocence of childhood. Except as counteracted
by the efficient grace of the Holy Spirit in the heart,
the Word (2 Tim. iii. 13) is ever visibly fulfilled, "evil
men wax worse and worse." Sin may not develop
in all with equal rapidity, but it does progress in every
natural man, outwardly or inwardly, with equal certainty.</p>

<p>It is another mark of leprosy that sooner or later it
<em>affects the whole man</em>; and in this, again, appears the
sad fitness of the disease to stand as a symbol of sin.
For sin is not a partial disorder, affecting only one
class of faculties, or one part of our nature. It disorders
the judgment; it obscures our moral perceptions;
it either perverts the affections, or unduly stimulates
them in one direction, while it deadens them in another;
it hardens and quickens the will for evil, while it
paralyses its power for the volition of that which is
holy. And not only the Holy Scripture, but observation
itself, teaches us that sin, in many cases, also affects
the body of man, weakening its powers, and bringing
in, by an inexorable law, pain, disease, and death.
Sooner or later, then, sin affects the whole man. And
for that reason, again, is leprosy set forth as its pre-eminent
symbol.</p>

<p>It is another remarkable feature of the disease that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
as it progresses from bad to worse, the victim becomes
more and more <em>insensible</em>. This numbness or insensibility
of the spots affected&mdash;in one most common variety
at least&mdash;is a constant feature. In some cases it becomes
so extreme that a knife may be thrust into the
affected limb, or the diseased flesh may be burnt with
fire, and yet the leper feels no pain. Nor is the insensibility
confined to the body, but, as the leprosy
extends, the mind is affected in an analogous manner.
A recent writer says: "Though a mass of bodily corruption,
at last unable to leave his bed, the leper seems
happy and contented with his sad condition." Is
anything more characteristic than this of the malady
of sin? The sin which, when first committed, costs a
keen pang, afterward, when frequently repeated, hurts
not the conscience at all. Judgments and mercies,
which in earlier life affected one with profound emotion,
in later life leave the impenitent sinner as unmoved
as they found him. Hence we all recognise the fitness
of the common expression, "a seared conscience," as
also of the Apostle's description of advanced sinners
as men who are "past feeling" (Eph. iv. 19). Of
this moral insensibility which sin produces, then, we
are impressively reminded when the Holy Spirit in
the Word holds before us leprosy as a type of sin.</p>

<p>Another element of the solemn fitness of the type is
found in the persistently <em>hereditary</em> nature of leprosy.
It may indeed sometimes arise of itself, even as did
sin in the case of certain of the holy angels, and with
our first parents; but when once it is introduced, in
the case of any person, the terrible infection descends
with unfailing certainty to all his descendants; and
while, by suitable hygiene, it is possible to alleviate its
violence, and retard its development, it is not possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
to escape the terrible inheritance. Is anything more
uniformly characteristic of sin? We may raise no end
of metaphysical difficulties about the matter, and put
unanswerable questions about freedom and responsibility;
but there is no denying the hard fact that since
sin first entered the race, in our first parents, not a
child of man, of human father begotten, has escaped
the taint. If various external influences, as in the
case of leprosy, may, in some instances, modify its
manifestations, yet no individual, in any class or condition
of mankind, escapes the taint. The most cultivated
and the most barbarous alike, come into the
world so constituted that, quite antecedent to any act
of free choice on their part, we know that it is not
more certain that they will eat than that, when they
begin to exercise freedom, they will, each and every
one, use their moral freedom wrongly,&mdash;in a word, will
sin. No doubt, then, when such prominence is given
to leprosy among diseases, in the Mosaic symbolism
and elsewhere, it is with intent, among other truths, to
keep before the mind this very solemn and awful fact
with regard to the sin which it so fitly symbolises.</p>

<p>And, again, we find yet another analogy in the fact
that, among the ancient Hebrews, the disease was
regarded as <em>incurable</em> by human means; and, notwithstanding
occasional announcements in our day that a
remedy has been discovered for the plague, this seems
to be the verdict of the best authorities in medical
science still. That in this respect leprosy perfectly
represents the sorer malady of the soul, every one is
witness. No possible effort of will or fixedness of
determination has ever availed to free a man from
sin. Even the saintliest Christian has often to confess
with the Apostle Paul (Rom. vii. 19), "The evil which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
I would not, that I practise." Neither is culture,
whether intellectual or religious, of any more avail.
To this all human history testifies. In our day, despite
the sad lessons of long experience, many are
hoping for much from improved government, education,
and such like means; but vainly, and in the face of
the most patent facts. Legislation may indeed impose
restrictions on the more flagrant forms of sin, even as
it may be of service in restricting the devastations of
leprosy, and ameliorating the condition of lepers. But
to do away with sin, and abolish crime by any conceivable
legislation, is a dream as vain as were the hope
of curing leprosy by a good law or an imperial proclamation.
Even the perfect law of God has proved
inadequate for this end; the Apostle (Rom. viii. 3)
reminds us that in this it has failed, and could not but
fail, "in that it was weak through the flesh." Nothing
can well be of more importance than that we should be
keenly alive to this fact; that so we may not, through
our present apparently tolerable condition, or by temporary
alleviations of the trouble, be thrown off our
guard, and hope for ourselves or for the world, upon
grounds which afford no just reason for hope.</p>

<p>Last of all, the law of leprosy, as given in this chapter,
teaches the supreme lesson, that as with the symbolic
disease of the body, so with that of the soul, sin <em>shuts
out from God and from the fellowship of the holy</em>. As
the leper was excluded from the camp of Israel and
from the tabernacle of Jehovah, so must the sinner,
except cleansed, be shut out of the Holy City, and
from the glory of the heavenly temple. What a
solemnly significant parable is this exclusion of the
leper from the camp! He is thrust forth from the
congregation of Israel, wearing the insignia of mourning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
for the dead! Within the camp, the multitude of
them that go to the sanctuary of God, and that joyfully
keep holy day; without, the leper dwelling alone, in
his incurable corruption and never-ending mourning!
And so, while we do not indeed deny a sanitary intention
in these regulations of the law, but are rather
inclined to affirm it; yet of far more consequence is
it that we heed the spiritual truth which this solemn
symbolism teaches. It is that which is written in the
Apocalypse (xxi. 27; xxii. 15) concerning the New
Jerusalem: "There shall in no wise enter into it
anything unclean.... Without are the dogs, and the
sorcerers, and the fornicators, and the murderers, and the
idolaters, and every one that loveth and maketh a lie."</p>

<p>In view of all these correspondences, one need not
wonder that in the symbolism of the law leprosy holds
the place which it does. For what other disease can
be named which combines in itself, as a physical malady,
so many of the most characteristic marks of the malady
of the soul? In its intrinsic loathsomeness, its insignificant
beginnings, its slow but inevitable progress, in
the extent of its effects, in the insensibility which
accompanies it, in its hereditary character, in its incurability,
and, finally, in the fact that according to the law
it involved the banishment of the leper from the camp
of Israel,&mdash;in all these respects, it stands alone as a
perfect type of sin; it is sin, as it were, made visible
in the flesh.</p>

<p>This is indeed a dark picture of man's natural state,
and very many are exceedingly loth to believe that sin
can be such a very serious matter. Indeed, the fundamental
postulate of much of our nineteenth-century
thought, in matters both of politics and religion, denies
the truth of this representation, and insists, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
contrary, that man is naturally not bad, but good; and
that, on the whole, as the ages go by, he is gradually
becoming better and better. But it is imperative that
our views of sin and of humanity shall agree with the
representations held before us in the Word of God.
When that Word, not only in type, as in this chapter,
but in plain language (Jer. xvii. 9, R.V.), declares that
"the heart is deceitful above all things, and it is <em>desperately
sick</em>," it must be a very perilous thing to deny this.</p>

<p>It is a profoundly instructive circumstance that,
according to this typical law, the case of the supposed
leper was to be judged by the priest (vv. 2, 3, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">et passim</i>).
All turned for him upon the priest's verdict. If he
declared him clean, it was well; but if he pronounced
him unclean, it made no difference that the man did
not believe it, or that his friends did not believe it; or
that he or they thought better in any respect of his
case than the priest,&mdash;out of the camp he must go. He
might plead that he was certainly not nearly in so bad
a case as some of the poor, mutilated, dying creatures
outside the camp; but that would have no weight,
however true. For still he, no less really than they,
was a leper; and, until made whole, into the fellowship
of lepers he must go and abide. Even so for us all;
everything turns, not on our own opinion of ourselves,
or on what other men may think of us; but solely on
the verdict of the heavenly Priest.</p>

<p>The picture thus set before us in the symbolism of
this chapter is sad enough; but it would be far more
sad did the law not now carry forward the symbolism
into the region of redemption, in making provision for
the cleansing of the leper, and his re-admission into the
fellowship of the holy people. To this our attention is
called in the next chapter.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</a></h2>

<h3><em>THE CLEANSING OF THE LEPER.</em></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lev.</span> xiv. 1-32.</p>


<p>The ceremonies for the restoration of the leper,
when healed of his disease, to full covenant privileges,
were comprehended in two distinct series. The
first part of the ceremonial took place without the
camp, and sufficed only to terminate his condition as
one ceremonially dead, and allow of his return into the
camp, and his association, though still under restriction,
with his fellow-Israelites. The second part of the
ceremonial took up his case on the eighth day thereafter,
where the former ceremonial had left him, as a
member, indeed, of the holy people, but a member still
under defilement such as debarred him from approach
to the presence of Jehovah; and, by a fourfold offering
and an anointing, restored him to the full enjoyment of
all his covenant privileges before God.</p>

<p>This law for the cleansing of the leper certainly
implies that the disease, although incurable by human
skill, yet, whether by the direct power of God, as in
several instances in Holy Scripture, or for some cause
unknown, might occasionally cease its ravages. In
this case, although the visible effects of the disease
might still remain, in mutilations and scars, yet he
would be none the less a healed man. That occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
instances have occurred of such arrest of the disease,
is attested by competent observers, and the law before
us thus provides for the restoration of the leper in
such cases to the position from which his leprosy had
excluded him.</p>

<p>The first part of the ceremonial (vv. 3-9) took place
without the camp; for until legally cleansed the man
was in the sight of the law still a leper, and therefore
under sentence of banishment from the congregation of
Israel. Thus, as the outcast could not go to the priest,
the priest, on receiving word of his desire, went to him.
For the ceremony which was to be performed, he provided
himself with two living, clean birds, and with
cedar-wood, and scarlet, and hyssop; also he took with
him an earthen vessel filled with living water,&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>,
with water from some spring or flowing stream, and
therefore presumably pure and clean. One of the
birds was then killed in such a manner that its blood
was received into the vessel of water; then the living
bird and the hyssop&mdash;bound, as we are told, with the
scarlet band to the cedar-wood&mdash;were dipped into the
mingled blood and water, and by them the leper was
sprinkled therewith seven times by the priest, and was
then pronounced clean; when the living bird, stained
with the blood of the bird that was killed, was allowed
to fly away. Thereupon, the leper washed his clothes,
shaved off all his hair, bathed in water, and entered the
camp. This completed the first stadium of his restoration.</p>

<p>Certain things about this symbolism seem very clear.
First of all, whereas the leper, afflicted, as it were, with
a living death, had become, as regards Israel, a man
legally dead, the sprinkling with blood, in virtue of
which he was allowed to take his place again in the
camp as a living Israelite, symbolized the impartation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
of life; and, again, inasmuch as death is defiling, the
blood was mingled with water, the uniform symbol of
cleansing. The remaining symbols emphasise thoughts
closely related to these. The cedar-wood (or juniper),
which is almost incorruptible, signified that with this
new life was imparted also freedom from corruption.
Scarlet, as a colour, is the constant symbol, again, like
the blood, of life and health. What the hyssop was
is still in debate; but we can at least safely say that
it was a plant supposed to have healing and purifying
virtues.</p>

<p>So far all is clear. But what is the meaning of the
slaying of the one bird, and the loosing afterward of
the other, moistened with the blood of its fellow?
Some have said that both of the birds symbolised the
leper: the one which was slain, the leper as he was,&mdash;namely,
as one dead, or under sentence of death by his
plague; the other, naturally, then, the leper as healed,
who, even as the living bird is let fly whither it will, is
now set at liberty to go where he pleases. But when
we consider that it is by means of being sprinkled with
the blood of the slain bird that the leper is cleansed,
it seems quite impossible that this slain bird should
typify the leper in his state of defilement. Indeed, if
this bird symbolised him as under his disease, this
supposition seems even absurd; for the blood which
cleansed must then have represented his own blood,
and his blood as diseased and unclean!</p>

<p>Neither is it possible that the other bird, which was
set at liberty, should represent the leper as healed, and
its release, his liberation; however plausible, at first
thought, this explanation may seem. For the very same
ceremony as this with the two birds was also to be
used in the cleansing of a leprous house (vv. 50-53),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
where it is evident that the loosing of the living bird
could not have any such significance; since the notion
of a liberty given would be wholly inapplicable in the
case of a house. But whatever the true meaning of
the symbolism may be, it is clear that it must be one
which will apply equally well in each of the two cases,
the cleansing of the leprous house, no less than that
of the leprous person.</p>

<p>We are therefore compelled to regard the slaying of
the one bird as a true sacrifice. No doubt there are
difficulties in the way, but they do not seem insuperable,
and are, in any case, less than those which beset other
suppositions. It is true that the birds are not presented
before Jehovah in the tabernacle; but as the
ceremony took place outside the camp, and therefore at
a distance from the tabernacle, this may be explained as
merely because of the necessity of the case. It is true,
again, that the choice of the bird was not limited, as in
the tabernacle sacrifices, to the turtle-dove or pigeon;
but it might easily be that when, as in this case, the
sacrifice was elsewhere than at the tabernacle, the rules
for service there did not necessarily apply. Finally
and decisively, when we turn to the law for the
cleansing of the leprous house, we find that atoning
virtue is explicitly ascribed to this rite with the birds
(ver. 53): "He shall make atonement for the house."</p>

<p>But sacrifice is here presented in a different aspect
from elsewhere in the law. In this ceremonial the
central thought is not consecration through sacrifice, as
in the burnt-offering; nor expiation of guilt through
sacrifice, as in the sin-offering; nor yet satisfaction for
trespass committed, as in the guilt-offering. It is sacrifice
as procuring for the man for whom it is offered
purity and life, which is the main thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<p>But, according to vv. 52, 53, the atonement is made
with both the dead and the living bird. The special
thought which is emphasised by the use of the latter,
seems to be merely the full completeness of the work
of cleansing which has been accomplished through
the death of the other bird. For the living bird was
represented as ideally identified with the bird which
was slain, by being dipped in its blood; and in that it
was now loosed from its captivity, this was in token
of the fact that the bird, having now given its life to
impart cleansing and life to the leper, has fully accomplished
that end.</p>

<p>Obviously, this explanation is one that will apply no
less readily to the cleansing of the leprous house than
of the leprous person. For the leprosy in the house
signifies the working of corruption and of decay and
death in the wall of the house, in a way adapted to its
nature, as really as in the case of the person; and the
ceremonial with the birds and other material prescribed
means the same with it as with the other,&mdash;namely, the
removal of the principle of corruption and disease, and
impartation of purity and wholesomeness. In both
cases the sevenfold sprinkling, as in analogous cases
elsewhere in the law, signified the completeness of
the cleansing, to which nothing was lacking, and also
certified to the leper that by this impartation of new
life, and by his cleansing, he was again brought into
covenant relations with Jehovah.</p>

<p>With these ceremonies, the leper's cleansing was
now in so far effected that he could enter the camp;
only he must first cleanse himself and his clothes with
water and shave his hair,&mdash;ceremonies which, in their
primary meaning, are most naturally explained by the
importance of an actual physical cleansing in such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
case. Every possible precaution must be taken that
by no chance he bring the contagion of his late disease
into the camp. Of what special importance in this
connection, besides the washing, is the shaving of the
hair, will be apparent to all who know how peculiarly
retentive is the hair of odours and infections of every
kind.</p>

<p>The cleansed man might now come into the camp;
he is restored to his place as a living Israelite. And
yet he may not come to the tabernacle. For even an
Israelite might not come, if defiled for the dead; and
this is precisely the leper's status at this point.
Though delivered from the power of death, there is
yet persisting such a connection of his new self with
his old leprous self as precludes him from yet entering
the more immediate presence of God. The reality
of this analogy will appear to any one who compares
the rites which now follow (vv. 10-20) with those
appointed for the Nazarite, when defiled by the dead
(Numb. vi. 9-12).</p>

<p>Seven days, then, as in that case, he remains away
from the tabernacle. On the seventh day, he again
shaves himself even to the eyebrows, thus ensuring
the most absolute cleanness, and washes himself and
his clothes in water. The final restoration ceremonial
took place on the eighth day,&mdash;the day symbolic of the
new creation,&mdash;when he appeared before Jehovah at
the tent of meeting with a he-lamb for a guilt-offering,
and another for a sin-offering, and a ewe-lamb for a
burnt-offering; also a meal-offering of three tenth-deals,
one tenth for each sacrifice, mingled with oil, and
a log (3·32 qts.) of oil. The oil was then waved for
a wave-offering before the Lord, as also the whole
lamb of the guilt-offering (an unusual thing), and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
the lamb was slain and offered after the manner of the
guilt-offering.</p>

<p>And now followed the most distinctive part of the
ceremonial. As in the case of the consecration of the
priests was done with the blood of the peace-offering
and with the holy oil, so was it done here with the
blood of the guilt-offering and with the common oil&mdash;now
by its waving consecrated to Jehovah&mdash;which the
cleansed leper had brought. The priest anoints the
man's right ear, the thumb of his right hand, and
the great toe of his right foot, first with the blood of
the guilt-offering, and then with the oil, having previously
sprinkled of the oil seven times with his finger
before the Lord. The remnant of the oil in the hand
of the priest he then pours upon the cleansed leper's
head; then offers for him the sin-offering, the burnt-offering,
and the meal-offering; and therewith, at last,
the atonement is complete, and the man is restored to
his full rights and privileges as a living member of the
people of the living God.</p>

<p>The chief significance of this ceremonial lies in the
prominence given to the guilt-offering. This is evidenced,
not only by the special and peculiar use which
is made of its blood, in applying it to the leper, but
also in the fact that in the case of the poor man, while
the other offerings are diminished, there is no diminution
allowed as regards the lamb of the guilt-offering,
and the log of oil. Why should the guilt-offering have
received on this occasion such a place of special prominence?
The answer has been rightly given by those
who point to the significance of the guilt-offering as
representing reparation and satisfaction for loss of
service due. By the fact of the man's leprosy, and
consequent exclusion from the camp of Israel, God had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
been, for the whole period of his excision, defrauded,
so to speak, of His proper dues from him in respect
of service and offerings; and the guilt-offering precisely
symbolised satisfaction made for this default in service
which he had otherwise been able to render.</p>

<p>Nor is it a fatal objection to this understanding of
the matter that, on this principle, he also that for a
long time had had an issue should have been required,
for his prolonged default of service, to bring a guilt-offering
in order to his restoration; whereas from him
no such demand was made. For the need, before the
law, for the guilt-offering lay, not in the duration of
the leprosy, as such apprehend it, but in the nature of
the leprosy, as being, unlike any other visitation, in
a peculiar sense, a death in life. Even when the man
with an issue was debarred from the sanctuary, he
was not, like the leper, regarded by the law as a dead
man; but was still counted among them that were
living in Israel. And if precluded for an indefinite
time from the service and worship of God at the
tabernacle, he yet, by his public submission to the
demands of the law, in the presence of all, rendered
still to God the honour due from a member of the
living Israel. But in that the leper, unlike any other
defiled person, was reckoned ceremonially dead, obviously
consistency in the symbolism made it impossible
to regard him as having in any sense rendered honour
or service to God so long as he continued a leper, any
more than if he had been dead and buried. Therefore
he must bring a guilt-offering, as one who had, however
unavoidably, committed "a trespass in the holy
things of the Lord." And so this guilt-offering, in the
case of the leper, as in all others, represented the
satisfaction of debt; and as the reality or the amount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
of a debt cannot be affected by the poverty of the
debtor, the offering which symbolised satisfaction for
the debt must be the same for the poor leper as for
the rich leper.</p>

<p>And the application of the blood to ear, hand, and
foot meant the same as in the case of the consecration
of the priests. Inducted, as one now risen from the
dead, into the number of the priestly people, he receives
the priestly consecration, devoting ear, hand,
and foot to the service of the Lord. And as it was
fitting that the priests, because brought into a relation
of special nearness to God, in order to be ministers of
reconciliation to Israel, should therefore be consecrated
with the blood of the peace-offering, which specially
emphasised the realisation of reconciliation,&mdash;so the
cleansed leper, who was re-established as a living
member of the priestly nation, more especially by the
blood of the guilt-offering, was therefore fittingly
represented as consecrated in virtue, and by means
of that fact.</p>

<p>So, like the priests, he also was anointed by the
priest with oil; not indeed with the holy oil, for he
was not admitted to the priestly order; yet with
common oil, sanctified by its waving before God, in
token of his consecration as a member of the priestly
people. Especially suitable in his case was this
anointing, that the oil constantly stands as a symbol
of healing virtue, which in his experience he had so
wondrously received.</p>

<p>Remembering in all this how the leprosy stands as a
pre-eminent type of sin, in its aspect as involving death
and corruption, the application of these ceremonies to
the antitypical cleansing, at least in its chief aspects,
is almost self-evident. As in all the Levitical types, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
in this case, at the very entrance on the redeemed
life stands the sacrifice of a life, and the service of a
priest as mediator between God and man. Blood must
be shed if the leper is to be admitted again into covenant
standing with God; and the blood of the sacrifice
in the law ever points to the sacrifice of Christ. But
that great Sacrifice may be regarded in various aspects.
Sin is a many-sided evil, and on every side it must be
met. As often repeated, because sin as guilt requires
expiation, hence the type of the sin-offering; in that it
is a defrauding of God of His just rights from us, satisfaction
is required, hence the type of the guilt-offering;
as it is absence of consecration, life for self instead of
life for God, hence the type of the burnt-offering. And
yet the manifold aspects of sin are not all enumerated.
For sin, again, is spiritual death; and, as death, it
involves corruption and defilement. It is with special
reference to this fact that the work of Christ is brought
before us here. In the clean bird, slain that its blood
may be applied to the leper for cleansing, we see typified
Christ, as giving Himself, that His very life may be
imparted to us for our life. In that the blood of the
bird is mingled with water, the symbol of the Word of
God, is symbolised the truth, that with the atoning
blood is ever inseparably united the purifying energy
of the Holy Ghost through the Word. Not the water
without the blood, nor the blood without the water,
saves, but the blood with the water, and the water with
the blood. So it is said of Him to whom the ceremony
pointed (1 John v. 6): "This is He that came
by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not with the
water only, but with the water and with the blood."</p>

<p>But the type yet lacks something for completeness;
and for this reason we have the second bird, who, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
by his means the blood has been sprinkled on the
leper, and the man is now pronounced clean, is released
and flies away heavenward. What a beautiful symbol
of that other truth, without which even the atonement
of the Lord were nought, that He who died, having by
that death for us procured our life, was then released
from the bonds of death, rising from the dead on the
third day, and ascending to heaven, like the freed
bird, in token that His life-giving, cleansing work was
done. Thus the message which, as the liberated bird
flies carolling away, sweet as a heavenly song, seems
to fall upon the ear, is this, "Delivered up for our
trespasses, and raised for our justification" (Rom. iv.
25; see <em>Gr.</em>).</p>

<p>But although thus and then restored to his standing
as a member of the living people of God, not yet was the
cleansed leper allowed to appear in the presence of God
at the tent of meeting. There was a delay of a week, and
only then, on the eighth day, the day typical of resurrection
and new creation, does He appear before God.
Is there typical meaning in this delay? We would not
be too confident. It is quite possible that this delay
of a week, before the cleansed man was allowed to
present himself for the completion of the ceremonial
which reinstated him in the plenary enjoyment of all
the rights and privileges of a child of Israel, may have
been intended merely as a precautionary rule, of which
the purpose was to guard against the possibility of
infection, and the defilement of the sanctuary by his
presence, through renewed activity of the disease; while,
at the same time, it would serve as a spiritual discipline
to remind the man, now cleansed, of the extreme
care and holy fear with which, after his defilement, he
should venture into the presence of the Holy One of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
Israel; and thus, by analogy, it becomes a like lesson
to the spiritually cleansed in all ages.</p>

<p>But perhaps we may see a deeper significance in this
week of delay, and his appointed appearance before the
Lord on the eighth day. If the whole course of the
leper, from the time of his infection till his final reappearing
in the presence of Jehovah at the tent of meeting,
be intended to typify the history and experience
of a sinner as saved from sin; and if the cleansing of
the leper without the camp, and his reinstatement thereupon
as a member of God's Israel, represents in type
the judicial reinstatement of the cleansed sinner, through
the application of the blood and Spirit of Christ, in the
number of God's people; one can then hardly fail to
recognise in the week's delay appointed to him, before
he could come into the immediate presence of God, an
adumbration of the fact that between the sinner's acceptance
and the appointed time of his appearing, finally
and fully cleansed, before the Lord, on the resurrection
morning, there intervenes a period of delay, even the
whole lifetime of the believer here in the flesh and in
the disembodied state. For only thereafter does he at
last, wholly perfected, appear before God in the heavenly
Zion. But before thus appearing, the accepted man
once and again had to cleanse his garments and his
person, that so he might remove everything in which by
any chance uncleanness might still lurk. Which, translated
into New Testament language, gives us the charge
of the Apostle Paul (2 Cor. vii. 1) addressed to those
who had indeed received the new life, but were still in the
flesh: "Let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of
flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God."</p>

<p>But, at last, the week of delay is ended. After its
seventh day follows an eighth, the first-day morning of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
a new week, the morning typical of resurrection and
therewith completed redemption, and the leper now,
completely restored, appears before God in the holy
tabernacle. Even so shall an eighth-day morning
dawn for all who by the cleansing blood have been
received into the number of God's people. And when
that day comes, then, even as when the cleansed man
appeared at the tent of meeting, he presented guilt-offering,
sin-offering, and burnt-offering, as the warrant
for his presence there, and the ground of his acceptance,
so shall it be in that day of resurrection, when every one
of God's once leprous but now washed and accepted
children shall appear in Zion before Him. They will
all appear there as pleading the blood, the precious
blood of Christ; Christ, at last apprehended and received
by them in all His fulness, as expiation, satisfaction,
and righteousness. For so John represents it in
the apocalyptic vision of the blood-washed multitude in
the heavenly glory (Rev. vii. 14, 15): "These are they
which come out of the great tribulation, and they
washed their robes, and made them white in the blood
of the Lamb. <em>Therefore</em> are they before the throne of
God; and they serve Him day and night in His temple."</p>

<p>And as it is written (Rom. viii. 11) that the final
quickening of our mortal bodies shall be accomplished
by the Spirit of God, so the leper, now in God's
presence, receives a special anointing; a type of the
unction of the Holy Ghost in resurrection power, consecrating
the once leprous ear, hand, and foot, and
therewith the whole body, now cleansed from all defilement,
to the glad service of Jehovah our God and our
Redeemer.</p>

<p>Such, in outline at least, appears to be the typical
significance of this ceremonial of the cleansing of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
leper. Some details are indeed still left unexplained,
but, probably, the whole reason for some of the regulations
is to be found in the immediate practical necessities
of the leper's condition.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Of Leprosy in a Garment or House.</span></p>

<p class="center">xiii. 47-59; xiv. 33-53.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it be
a woollen garment, or a linen garment; whether it be in warp, or
woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in any thing
made of skin; if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or
in the skin, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin;
it is the plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto the priest: and
the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up that which hath the
plague seven days: and he shall look on the plague on the seventh
day: if the plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or
in the woof, or in the skin, whatever service skin is used for; the
plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean. And he shall burn the
garment, whether the warp or the woof, in woollen or in linen, or
any thing of skin, wherein the plague is: for it is a fretting leprosy;
it shall be burnt in the fire. And if the priest shall look, and,
behold, the plague be not spread in the garment, either in the warp,
or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; then the priest shall command
that they wash the thing wherein the plague is, and he shall
shut it up seven days more: and the priest shall look, after that the
plague is washed: and, behold, if the plague have not changed its
colour, and the plague be not spread, it is unclean; thou shalt burn it
in the fire: it is a fret, whether the bareness be within or without.
And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be dim after the washing
thereof, then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the
skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof: and if it appear still
in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing
of skin, it is breaking out: thou shalt burn that wherein the plague
is with fire. And the garment, either the warp, or the woof, or whatsoever
thing of skin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be
departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and
shall be clean. This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of
woollen or linen, either in the warp, or the woof, or any thing of skin,
to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.... And the Lord
spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, When ye be come into
the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession; then
he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, There
seemeth to me to be as it were a plague in the house: and the priest
shall command that they empty the house, before the priest go in to
see the plague, that all that is in the house be not made unclean:
and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house: and he shall
look on the plague, and, behold, if the plague be in the walls of the
house with hollow strakes, greenish or reddish, and the appearance
thereof be lower than the wall; then the priest shall go out of the
house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days:
and the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look: and,
behold, if the plague be spread in the walls of the house; then the
priest shall command that they take out the stones in which the
plague is, and cast them into an unclean place without the city: and
he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they
shall pour out the mortar that they scrape off without the city into an
unclean place: and they shall take other stones, and put them in the
place of those stones; and he shall take other mortar, and shall
plaister the house. And if the plague come again, and break out in
the house, after that he hath taken out the stones, and after he hath
scraped the house, and after it is plaistered; then the priest shall
come in and look, and, behold, if the plague be spread in the house, it
is a fretting leprosy in the house: it is unclean. And he shall break
down the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the
mortar of the house; and he shall carry them forth out of the city
into an unclean place. Moreover he that goeth into the house all
the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even. And he
that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that eateth in the
house shall wash his clothes. And if the priest shall come in, and look,
and, behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was
plaistered; then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because
the plague is healed. And he shall take to cleanse the house two
birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop: and he shall kill one
of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water: and he shall
take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living
bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running
water, and sprinkle the house seven times: and he shall cleanse the
house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and
with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop,
and with the scarlet: but he shall let go the living bird out of the
city into the open field: so shall he make atonement for the house:
and it shall be clean."</p></blockquote>

<p>There has been much debate as to what we are to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
understand by the leprosy in the garment or in a
house. Was it an affection identical in nature with the
leprosy of the body? or was it merely so called from a
certain external similarity to that plague?</p>

<p>However extraordinary the former supposition might
once have seemed, in the present state of medical
science we are at least able to say that there is
nothing inconceivable in it. We have abundant experimental
evidence that a large number of diseases, and,
not improbably, leprosy among them, are caused by
minute parasitic forms of vegetable life; and, also,
that in many cases these forms of life may, and do,
exist and multiply in various other suitable media
besides the fluids and tissues of the human body.
If, as is quite likely, leprosy be caused by some such
parasitic life in the human body, it is then evidently
possible that such parasites, under favourable
conditions of heat, moisture, etc., should exist and
propagate themselves, as in other analogous cases, outside
the body; as, for instance, in cloth, or leather, or
in the plaster of a house; in which case it is plain
that such garments or household implements, or such
dwellings, as might be thus infected, would be certainly
unwholesome, and presumably capable of communicating
the leprosy to the human subject. But we have
not yet sufficient scientific observation to settle the
question whether this is really so; we can, however,
safely say that, in any case, the description which is
here given indicates a growth in the affected garment
or house of some kind of mould or mildew; which, as
we know, is a form of life produced under conditions
which always imply an unwholesome state of the
article or house in which it appears. We also know
that if such growths be allowed to go on unchecked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
they involve more or less rapid processes of decomposition
in that which is affected. Thus, even from a
merely natural point of view, one can see the high
wisdom of the Divine King of Israel in ordering that,
in all such cases, the man whose garment or house was
thus affected should at once notify the priest, who was
to come and decide whether the appearance was of a
noxious and unclean kind or not, and then take action
accordingly.</p>

<p>Whether the suspicious spot were in a house or in
some article it contained, the article or house (the latter
having been previously emptied) was first shut up for
seven days (xiii. 50; xiv. 38). If in the garment or
other article affected it was found then to have spread,
it was without any further ceremony to be burnt (xiii.
51, 52). If it had not spread, it was to be washed and
shut up seven days more, at the end of which time,
even though it had not spread, if the greenish or reddish
colour remained unchanged, it was still to be adjudged
unclean, and to be burned (xiii. 55). If, on the other
hand, the colour had somewhat "dimmed," the part
affected was to be cut out; when, if it spread no further,
it was to be washed a second time, and be pronounced
clean (xiii. 58). If, however, after the excision of the
affected part, the spot appeared again, the article,
without further delay, was to be burned (xiii. 57).</p>

<p>The law, in the case of the appearing of a leprosy
in a house (xiv. 33-53), was much more elaborate. As
in the former case, when the occupant of the house
suspects, "as it were a plague in the house," he is to
go and tell the priest; who is, first of all, to order the
emptying of the house before he goes in, lest that which
is in the house, should it prove to be the plague, be
made unclean (ver. 36). The diagnosis reminds us of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
that of the leprosy in the body; greenish or reddish
streaks, in appearance "lower than the wall," <em>i.e.</em>, deep-seated
(ver. 37). Where this is observed, the empty
house is to be shut up for seven days (ver. 38); and
at the end of that time, if the spot has spread, "the
stones in which the plague is" are to be taken out, the
plaster scraped off the walls of the house, and all carried
out into an unclean place outside of the city, and new
stones and new plaster put in the place of the old
(vv. 40-42). If, after this, the plague yet reappear, the
house is to be adjudged unclean, and is to be wholly
torn down, and all the material carried into an unclean
place without the city (vv. 44, 45). If, on the other
hand, after this renewal of the interior of the house,
the spots do not reappear, the priest "shall pronounce
the house clean, because the plague is healed" (ver. 48).
But, unlike the case of the leprous garment, this does
not end the ceremonial. It is ordered that the priest
shall take to cleanse (<em>lit.</em> "to purge the house from sin")
(ver. 49) two birds, scarlet, cedar, and hyssop, which
are then used precisely as in the case of the purgation
of the leprous man; and at the end, "he shall let go
the living bird out of the city into the open field: so
shall he make atonement for the house: and it shall
be clean" (vv. 50-53).</p>

<p>For the time then present, one can hardly fail to see
in this ceremonial, first, a merciful sanitary intent. By
the observance of these regulations not only was Israel
to be saved from many sicknesses and various evils,
but was to be constantly reminded that Israel's God, like
a wise and kind Father, had a care for everything that
pertained to their welfare; not only for their persons,
but also for their dwellings, and even all the various
articles of daily use. The lesson is always in force,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
for God has not changed. He is not a God who cares
for the souls of men only, but for their bodies also, and
everything around them. His servants do well to remember
this, and in this imitate Him, as happily many
are doing more and more. Bibles and tracts are good,
and religious exhortation; but we have here left us a
Divine warrant not to content ourselves with these
things alone, but to have a care for the clothing and
the homes of those we would reach with the Gospel. In
all the large cities of Christendom it must be confessed
that the principle which underlies these laws concerning
houses and garments, is often terribly neglected.
Whether the veritable plague of leprosy be in the
walls of many of our tenement houses or not, there can
be no doubt that it could not be much worse if it were;
and Christian philanthropy and legislation could scarcely
do better in many cases than vigorously to enforce the
Levitical law, tear down, re-plaster, or, in many cases,
destroy from the foundation, tenement houses, which
could, with little exaggeration, be justly described as
leprous throughout.</p>

<p>But all which is in this law cannot be thus explained.
Even the Israelite must have looked beyond this for
the meaning of the ordinance of the two birds, the cedar,
scarlet, and hyssop, and the "atonement" for the house.
He would have easily perceived that not only leprosy
in the body, but this leprosy in the garment and the
house, was a sign that both the man himself, and his
whole environment as well, was subject to death and
decay; that, as already he would have learned from the
Book of Genesis, even nature was under a curse because
of man's sin; and that, as in the Divine plan, sacrificial
cleansing was required for the deliverance of man, so
also it was somehow mysteriously required for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
cleansing of his earthly abode and surroundings, in
default of which purgation they must be destroyed.</p>

<p>And from this to the antitypical truth prefigured by
these laws it is but a step; and a step which we take
with full New Testament light to guide us. For if the
leprosy in the body visibly typified the working of sin
and death in the soul of man, then, as clearly, the leprosy
in the house must in this law be intended to symbolise
the working of sin in the material earthly creation,
which is man's abode. The type thus brings before us
the truth which is set forth by the Apostle Paul in
Rom. viii. 20-22, where we are taught in express words
that, not man alone, but the whole creation also,
because of sin, has come under a "bondage of corruption."
"The creation was subjected to vanity, not of its
own will, but by reason of him who subjected it....
For we know that the whole creation groaneth and
travaileth in pain together until now." This is one
truth which is shadowed forth in this type.</p>

<p>But the type also shows us how, as Scripture elsewhere
clearly teaches, if after such partial purgation as
was effected by means of the deluge the bondage of
corruption still persist, then the abode of man must itself
be destroyed; "the earth and the works that are therein
shall be burned up" (2 Peter iii. 10). Nothing less than
fire will suffice to put an end to the working in material
nature of this mysterious curse. And yet beyond the
fire is redemption. For the atonement shall avail not
only for the leprous man, but for the purifying of the
leprous abode. The sprinkling of sacrificial blood and
water by means of the cedar, and hyssop, and scarlet,
and the living bird, which effected the deliverance of
the leper, are used also in the same way and for the
same end, for the leprous house. And so "according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
to his promise, we look for new heavens and a new
earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness" (2 Peter iii. 13);
and it shall be brought in through the virtue of atonement
made by a Saviour slain, and applied by a Saviour
alive from the dead; so that, as the free bird flies away
in token of the full completion of deliverance from the
curse, so "the creation itself also shall be delivered
from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the
glory of the children of God" (Rom. viii. 21).</p>

<p>But there was also a leprosy of the garment. If the
leprosy in the body typified the effect of sin in the soul,
and the leprosy in the house, the effect of sin in the
earthly creation, which is man's home; the leprosy of
the garment can scarcely typify anything else than the
presence and effects of sin in those various relations in
life which constitute our present environment. Whenever,
in any of these, we suspect the working of sin,
first of all we are to lay the case before the heavenly
Priest. And then, if He with the "eyes like a flame
of fire" (Rev. i. 14; ii. 18) declare anything unclean,
then that in which the stain is found must be without
hesitation cut out and thrown away. And if still, after
this, we find the evil reappearing, then the whole garment
must go, fair and good though the most of it may
still appear. In other words, those relations and engagements
in which, despite all possible care and precaution,
we find manifest sin persistently reappearing, as if there
were in them, however inexplicably, an ineradicable
tendency to evil,&mdash;these we must resolutely put away,
"hating even the garment spotted by the flesh."</p>

<p>The leprous garment must be burnt. For its restoration
or purification the law made no provision. For
here, in the antitype, we are dealing with earthly
relationships, which have only to do with the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
life and order. "The fashion of this world passeth
away" (1 Cor. vii. 31). There shall be "new heavens
and a new earth," but in that new creation the old
environment shall be found no longer. The old garments,
even such as were best, shall be no longer
used. The redeemed shall walk with the King and
Redeemer, clothed in the white robes which He shall
give. No more leprosy then in person, house, or
garment! For we shall be set before the presence of
the Father's glory, without blemish, in exceeding joy,
"not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing."
Wherefore "to the only God our Saviour, through
Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion
and power, before all time, and now, and for evermore.
Amen."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</a></h2>

<h3><em>OF HOLINESS IN EATING.</em></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lev.</span> xvii. 1-16.</p>


<p>With this chapter begins another subdivision of
the law. Hitherto we have had before us only
sacrificial worship and matters of merely ceremonial
law. The law of holy living contained in the following
chapters (xvii.-xx.), on the other hand, has to do for
the most part with matters rather ethical than ceremonial,
and consists chiefly of precepts designed to
regulate morally the ordinary engagements and relationships
of every-day life. The fundamental thought of
the four chapters is that which is expressed, <em>e.g.</em>, in
xviii. 3: Israel, redeemed by Jehovah, is called to be a
holy people; and this holiness is to be manifested in a
total separation from the ways of the heathen. This
principle is enforced by various specific commands and
prohibitions, which naturally have particular regard to
the special conditions under which Israel was placed,
as a holy nation consecrated to Jehovah, the one, true
God, but living in the midst of nations of idolaters.</p>

<p>The whole of chapter xvii., with the exception of
vv. 8, 9, has to do with the application of this law of
holy living to the use even of lawful food. At first
thought, the injunctions of the chapter might seem to
belong rather to ceremonial than to moral law; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
closer observation will show that all the injunctions
here given have direct reference to the avoidance of
idolatry, especially as connected with the preparation
and use of food.</p>

<p>It was not enough that the true Israelite should
abstain from food prohibited by God, as in chap. xii.;
he must also use that which was permitted in a way
well-pleasing to God, carefully shunning even the
appearance of any complicity with surrounding idolatry,
or fellowship with the heathen in their unholy fashions
and customs. Even so for the Christian: it is not
enough that he abstain from what is expressly forbidden;
even in his use of lawful food, he must so use
it that it shall be to him a means of grace, in helping
him to maintain an uninterrupted walk with God.</p>

<p>In vv. 1-7 is given the law to regulate the use of
such clean animals for food as could be offered to God
in sacrifice; in vv. 10-16, of such as, although permitted
for food, were not allowed for sacrifice.</p>

<p>The directions regarding the first class may be summed
up in this: all such animals were to be treated as peace-offerings.
No private person in Israel was to slaughter
any such animal anywhere in the camp or out of it,
except at the door of the tent of meeting. Thither
they were to be brought "unto the priest," and offered
for peace-offerings (ver. 5); the blood must be sprinkled
on the altar of burnt-offering; the fat parts burnt "for a
sweet savour unto the Lord" (ver. 6); and then only,
the priest having first taken his appointed portions, the
remainder might now be eaten by the Israelite, as
given back to him by God, in peaceful fellowship with
Him.</p>

<p>The law could not have been burdensome, as some
might hastily imagine. Even when obtainable, meat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
was probably not used as food by them so freely as
with us; and in the wilderness the lack of flesh, it will
be remembered, was so great as to have occasioned at
one time a rebellion among the people, who fretfully
complained (Numb. xi. 4): "Who shall give us flesh to
eat?"</p>

<p>Even the uncritical reader must be able to see how
manifest is the Mosaic date of this part of Leviticus.
The terms of this law suppose a camp-life; indeed, the
camp is explicitly named (ver. 3). That which was enjoined
was quite practicable under the conditions of life
in the wilderness, when, at the best, flesh was scarce,
and the people dwelt compactly together; but would
have been utterly inapplicable and impracticable at a
later date, after they were settled throughout the land
of Canaan, when to have slaughtered all beasts used
for food at the central sanctuary would have been
impossible. Hence we find that, as we should expect,
the modified law of Deuteronomy (xii. 15, 16, 20-24),
assuming the previous existence of this earlier law,
explicitly repeals it. To suppose that forgers of a later
day, as, for instance, of the time of Josiah, or after the
Babylonian exile, should have needlessly invented a
law of this kind, is an hypothesis which is rightly
characterised by Dillmann as "simply absurd."<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>This regulation for the wilderness days is said
(vv. 5, 7) to have been made "to the end that the
children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they
sacrifice in the open field ... unto the Lord, ... and
sacrifice them for sacrifices of peace offerings unto the
Lord.... And they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices
unto the he-goats, after whom they go a whoring."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span></p>

<p>There can be no doubt that in the last sentence, "he-goats,"
as in the Revised Version, instead of "devils,"
as in the Authorised, is the right rendering. The worship
referred to was still in existence in the days of the
monarchy; for it is included in the charges against
"Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin"
(2 Chron. xi. 15), that "he appointed him priests, ...
for the he-goats, and for the calves which he had
made." Nor can here we agree with Dillmann<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> that
in this worship of he-goats here referred to, there is
"no occasion to think of the goat-worship of Egypt."
For inasmuch as we know that the worship of the
sacred bull and that of the he-goat prevailed in Egypt in
those days, and inasmuch as in Ezekiel xx. 6, 7, 15-18,
repeated reference is made to Israel's having worshipped
"the idols of Egypt," one can hardly avoid combining
these two facts, and thus connecting the goat-worship
to which allusion is here made, with that which prevailed
at Mendes, in Lower Egypt. This cult at that
place was accompanied with nameless revolting rites,
such as give special significance to the description of
this worship (ver. 7) as "a whoring" after the goats;
and abundantly explain and justify the severity of the
penalty attached to the violation of this law (ver. 4) in
cutting off the offender from this people; all the more
when we observe the fearful persistency of this horrible
goat-worship in Israel, breaking out anew, as just
remarked, some five hundred years later, in the reign
of Jeroboam.</p>

<p>The words imply that the ordinary slaughter of
animals for food was often connected with some idolatrous
ceremony related to this goat-worship. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
precisely it may have been, we know not; but of such
customs, connecting the preparation of the daily food
with idolatry, we have abundant illustration in the
usages of the ancient Persians, the Hindoos, and the
heathen Arabs of the days before Mohammed. The law
was thus intended to cut out this every-day idolatry
by the root. With these "field-devils," as Luther
renders the word, the holy people of the Lord were to
have nothing to do.</p>

<p>Very naturally, the requirement to present all
slaughtered animals as peace-offerings to Jehovah
gives occasion to turn aside for a little from the matter
of food, which is the chief subject of the chapter, in
order to extend this principle beyond animals slaughtered
for food, and insist particularly that all burnt-offerings
and sacrifices of every kind should be sacrificed at the
door of the tent of meeting, and nowhere else. This
law, we are told (ver. 8), was to be applied, not only
to the Israelites themselves, but also to "strangers"
among them; such as, <em>e.g.</em>, were the Gibeonites. No
idolatry, nor anything likely to be associated with
it, was to be tolerated from any one in the holy
camp.</p>

<p>The principle which underlies this stringent law, as
also the reason which is given for it, is of constant
application in modern life. There was nothing wrong
in itself in slaying an animal in one place more than
another. It was abstractly possible&mdash;as, likely enough,
many an Israelite may have said to himself&mdash;that a
man could just as really "eat unto the Lord" if he
slaughtered and ate his animal in the field, as anywhere
else. Nevertheless this was forbidden under
the heaviest penalties. It teaches us that he who will
be holy must not only abstain from that which is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
itself always wrong, but must carefully keep himself
from doing even lawful or necessary things in such a
way, or under such associations and circumstances, as
may outwardly compromise his Christian standing, or
which may be proved by experience to have an almost
unavoidable tendency toward sin. The laxity in such
matters which prevails in the so-called "Christian
world" argues little for the tone of spiritual life in our
day in those who indulge in it, or allow it, or apologise
for it. It may be true enough, in a sense, that as
many say, there is no harm in this or that. Perhaps
not; but what if experience have shown that, though
in itself not sinful, a certain association or amusement
almost always tends to worldliness, which is a form of
idolatry? Or&mdash;to use the apostle's illustration&mdash;what if
one be seen, though with no intention of wrong, "sitting
at meat in an idol's temple," and he whose conscience
is weak be thereby emboldened to do what to him is
sin? There is only one safe principle, now as in the
days of Moses: everything must be brought "before
the Lord;" used as from Him and for Him, and therefore
used under such limitations and restrictions as His
wise and holy law imposes. Only so shall we be safe;
only so abide in living fellowship with God.</p>

<p>Very beautiful and instructive, again, was the direction
that the Israelite, in the cases specified, should
make his daily food a peace-offering. This involved
a dedication of the daily food to the Lord; and in his
receiving it back again then from the hand of God, the
truth was visibly represented that our daily food is
from God; while also, in the sacrificial acts which preceded
the eating, the Israelite was continually reminded
that it was upon the ground of an accepted atonement
that even these every-day mercies were received.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
Such also should be, in spirit, the often neglected prayer
before each of our daily meals. It should be ever offered
with the remembrance of the precious blood which has
purchased for us even the most common mercies; and
should thus sincerely recognise what, in the confusing
complexity of the second causes through which we
receive our daily food, we so easily forget: that the
Lord's prayer is not a mere form of words when we
say, "Give us this day our daily bread;" but that
working behind, and in, and with, all these second
causes, is the kindly Providence of God, who, opening
His hand, supplies the want of every living thing. And
so, eating in grateful, loving fellowship with our
Heavenly Father that which His bounty gives us, to
His glory, every meal shall become, as it were, a sacramental
remembrance of the Lord. We may have wondered
at what we have read of the world-wide custom
of the Mohammedan, who, whenever the knife of
slaughter is lifted against a beast for food, utters his
"<i>Bism allàh</i>," "In the name of the most merciful God;"
and not otherwise will regard his food as being made
<i>halàl</i>, or "lawful;" and, no doubt, in all this, as in
many a Christian's prayer, there may often be little
heart. But the thought in this ceremony is even this
of Leviticus, and we do well to make it our own, eating
even our daily food "in the name of the most merciful
God," and with uplifting of the heart in thankful worship
toward Him.</p>

<p>But there were many beasts which, although they
might not be offered to the Lord in sacrifice, were yet
"clean," and permitted to the Israelites as food. Such,
in particular, were clean animals that are taken in the
hunt or chase. In vv. 10-16 the law is given for the
use of these. It is prefaced by a very full and explicit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
prohibition of the eating of blood;<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> for while, as regards
the animals to be offered to the Lord, provision was
made with respect to the blood, that it was to be
sprinkled around the altar, there was the danger that
in other cases, where this was not permissible, the blood
might be used for food. Hence the prohibition against
eating "any manner of blood," on a twofold ground:
first (vv. 11, 14), that the life of the flesh is the blood;
and second (ver. 11), that, for this reason, God had
chosen the blood to be the symbol of life substituted
for the life of the guilty in atoning sacrifice: "I have
given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for
your souls." Hence, in order that this relation of the
blood to the forgiveness of sins might be constantly
kept before the mind, it was ordained that never should
the Israelite eat of flesh except the blood should first
have been carefully drained out. And it was to be
treated with reverence, as having thus a certain sanctity;
when the beast was taken in hunting, the Israelite
must (ver. 13) "pour out the blood thereof, and cover
it with dust;"&mdash;an act by which the blood, the life, was
symbolically returned to Him who in the beginning
said (Gen. i. 24), "Let the earth bring forth the living
creature after its kind." And because, in the case of
"that which dieth of itself," or is "torn of beasts," the
blood would not be thus carefully drained off, all such
animals (ver. 15) are prohibited as food.</p>

<p>It is profoundly instructive to observe that here,
again, we come upon declarations and a command, the
deep truth and fitness of which is only becoming clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
now after three thousand years. For, as the result of
our modern discoveries with regard to the constitution
of the blood, and the exact nature of its functions, we
in this day are able to say that it is not far from a
scientific statement of the facts, when we read (ver. 14),
"As to the life of all flesh, the blood thereof is all one
with the life thereof." For it is in just this respect that
the blood is most distinct from all other parts of the
body; that, whereas it conveys and mediates nourishment
to all, it is itself nourished by none; but by its
myriad cells brought immediately in contact with the
digested food, directly and immediately assimilates it to
itself. We are compelled to say that as regards the
physical life of man&mdash;which alone is signified by the
original term here&mdash;it is certainly true of the blood, as
of no other part of the organism, that "the life of all
flesh is the blood thereof."</p>

<p>And while it is true that, according to the text, a
spiritual and moral reason is given for the prohibition
of the use of blood as food, yet it is well worth noting
that, as has been already remarked in another connection,
the prohibition, as we are now beginning to see,
had also a hygienic reason. For Dr. de Mussy, in his
paper before the French Academy of Medicine already
referred to,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> calls attention to the fact that, not only
did the Mosaic laws exclude from the Hebrew dietary
animals "particularly liable to parasites;" but also that
"it is in the blood," so rigidly prohibited by Moses as
food, "that the germs or spores of infectious disease
circulate." Surely no one need fear, with some expositors,
lest this recognition of a sanitary intent in these
laws shall hinder the recognition of their moral and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
spiritual purport, which in this chapter is so expressly
taught. Rather should this cause us the more to wonder
and admire the unity which thus appears between the
demands and necessities of the physical and the moral
and spiritual life; and, in the discovery of the marvellous
adaptation of these ancient laws to the needs of both, to
find a new confirmation of our faith in God and in His
revealed Word. For thus do they appear to be laws
so far beyond the wisdom of that time, and so surely
beneficent in their working, that in view of this it should
be easy to believe that it must indeed have been the
Lord God, the Maker and Preserver of all flesh, who
spake all these laws unto His servant Moses.</p>

<p>The moral and spiritual purpose of this law concerning
the use of blood was apparently twofold. In the
first place, it was intended to educate the people to a
reverence for life, and purify them from that tendency
to bloodthirstiness which has so often distinguished
heathen nations, and especially those with whom Israel
was to be brought in closest contact. But secondly,
and chiefly, it was intended, as in the former part of
the chapter, everywhere and always to keep before the
mind the sacredness of the blood as being the appointed
means for the expiation of sin; given by God upon the
altar to make atonement for the soul of the sinner, "by
reason of the life" or soul with which it stood in such
immediate relation. Not only were they therefore to
abstain from the blood of such animals as could be
offered on the altar, but even from that of those which
could not be offered. Thus the blood was to remind
them, every time that they ate flesh, of the very solemn
truth that without shedding of blood there was no
remission of sin. The Israelite must never forget this;
even in the heat and excitement of the chase, he must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
pause and carefully drain the blood from the creature
he had slain, and reverently cover it with dust;&mdash;a
symbolic act which should ever put him in mind of the
Divine ordinance that the blood, the life, of a guiltless
victim must be given, in order to the forgiveness
of sin.</p>

<p>A lesson lies here for us regarding the sacredness of
all that is associated with sacred things. All that is
connected with God, and with His worship, especially
all that is connected with His revelation of Himself for
our salvation, is to be treated with the most profound
reverence. Even though the blood of the deer killed
in the chase could not be used in sacrifice, yet, because
it was blood, was in its essential nature like unto that
which was so used, therefore it must be treated with
a certain respect, and be always covered with earth. It
is the fashion of our age&mdash;and one which is increasing
in an alarming degree&mdash;to speak lightly of things which
are closely connected with the revelation and worship
of the holy God. Against everything of this kind the
spirit of this law warns us. Nothing which is associated
in any way with what is sacred is to be spoken
of or treated irreverently, lest we thus come to think
lightly of the sacred things themselves. This irreverent
treatment of holy things is a crying evil in many parts
of the English-speaking world, as also in continental
Christendom. We need to beware of it. After irreverence,
too often, by no obscure law, comes open
denial of the Holy One and of His holy Son, our Lord
and Saviour. The blood of Christ, which represented
that holy life which was given on the cross for our sins,
is holy&mdash;an infinitely holy thing! And what is God's
estimate of its sanctity we may perhaps learn&mdash;looking
through the symbol to that which was symbolised&mdash;from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
this law; which required that all blood, because
outwardly resembling the holy blood of sacrifice, and,
like it, the seat and vehicle of life, should be treated
with most careful reverence. And it is safe to say that
just those most need the lesson taught by this command
who find it the hardest to appreciate it, and to
whom its injunctions still seem regulations puerile and
unworthy, according to their fancy, of the dignity and
majesty of God.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</a></h2>


<h3><em>THE LAW OF HOLINESS: CHASTITY.</em></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lev.</span> xviii. 1-30.</p>


<p>Chapters xviii., xix., and xx., by a formal introduction
(xviii. 1-5) and a formal closing (xx.
22-26), are indicated as a distinct section, very commonly
known by the name, "the Law of Holiness." As this
phrase indicates, these chapters&mdash;unlike chap. xvii.,
which as to its contents has a character intermediate
between the ceremonial and moral law&mdash;consist substantially
of moral prohibitions and commandments throughout.
Of the three, the first two contain the prohibitions
and precepts of the law; the third (xx.), the penal
sanctions by which many of these were to be enforced.</p>

<p>The section opens (vv. 1, 2) with Jehovah's assertion
of His absolute supremacy, and a reminder to Israel of
the fact that He had entered into covenant relations
with them: "I am the Lord your God." With solemn
emphasis the words are again repeated, ver. 4; and yet
again in ver. 5: "I am the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> They would naturally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
call to mind the scene at Sinai, with its august and
appalling grandeur, attesting amid earthquake and fire
and tempest at once the being, power, and unapproachable
holiness of Him who then and there, with those
stupendous solemnities, in inexplicable condescension,
took Israel into covenant with Himself, to be to Himself
"a kingdom of priests and a holy nation." There could
be no question as to the right of the God thus revealed
to impose law; no question as to the peculiar obligation
upon Israel to keep His law; no question as to His
intolerance of sin, and full power and determination,
as the Holy One, to enforce whatever He commanded.
All these thoughts&mdash;thoughts of eternal moment&mdash;would
be called up in the mind of every devout Israelite,
as he heard or read this preface to the law of holiness.</p>

<p>The prohibitions which we find in chap. xviii. are not
given as an exhaustive code of laws upon the subjects
traversed, but rather deal with certain gross offences
against the law of chastity, which, as we know from
other sources, were horribly common at that time among
the surrounding nations. To indulgence in these crimes,
Israel, as the later history sadly shows, would be
especially liable; so contagious are evil example and
corrupt associations! Hence the general scope of the
chapter is announced in this form (ver. 3): "After the
doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye
not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan,
whither I bring you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye
walk in their statutes."</p>

<p>Instead of this, they were (ver. 4) to do God's
judgments, and keep His statutes, to walk in them,
bearing in mind whose they were. And as a further
motive it is added (ver. 5): "which if a man do, he
shall live in them;" that is, as the Chaldee paraphrast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
Onkelos, rightly interprets in the Targum, "with the
life of eternity." Which far-reaching promise is sealed
by the repetition, for the third time, of the words, "I
am the Lord." That is enough; for what Jehovah
promises, that shall certainly be!</p>

<p>The law begins (ver. 6) with a general statement of
the principle which underlies all particular prohibitions
of incest: "None of you shall approach to any that is
near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness;" and
then, for the fourth time, are iterated the words, "I
am the Lord." The prohibitions which follow require
little special explanation. As just remarked, they are
directed in particular to those breaches of the law of
chastity which were most common with the Egyptians,
from the midst of whom Israel had come; and with
the Canaanites, to whose land they were going. This
explains, for instance, the fulness of detail in the prohibition
of incestuous union with a sister or half-sister
(vv. 9, 11),&mdash;an iniquity very common in Egypt, having
the sanction of royal custom from the days of the
Pharaohs down to the time of the Ptolemies. The
unnatural alliance of a man with his mother, prohibited
in ver. 8, of which Paul declared (1 Cor. v. 1) that in his
day it did not exist among the Gentiles, was yet the
distinguishing infamy of the Medes and Persians for
many centuries. Union with an aunt, by blood or by
marriage, prohibited in vv. 12-14,&mdash;a connection less
gross, and less severely to be punished than the preceding,&mdash;seems
to have been permitted even among
the Israelites themselves while in Egypt, as is plain
from the case of Amram and Jochebed (Exod. vi. 20).
To the law forbidding connection with a brother's wife
(ver. 16), the later Deuteronomic law (Deut. xxv. 5-10),
made an exception, permitting that a man might marry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
the widow of his deceased brother, when the latter had
died without children, and "raise up seed unto his
brother." In this, however, the law but sanctioned a
custom which&mdash;as we learn from the case of Onan
(Gen. xxxviii.)&mdash;had been observed long before the
days of Moses, both by the Hebrews and other ancient
nations, and, indeed, even limited and restricted its
application; with good reason providing for exemption
of the surviving brother from this duty, in cases where
for any reason it might be repugnant or impracticable.</p>

<p>The case of a connection with both a woman and
her daughter or granddaughter is next mentioned
(ver. 17); and, with special emphasis, is declared to
be "wickedness," or "enormity."</p>

<p>The prohibition (ver. 18) of marriage with a sister-in-law,
as is well known, has been, and still is, the
occasion of much controversy, into which it is not
necessary here to enter at length. But, whatever may
be thought for other reasons as to the lawfulness of
such a union, it truly seems quite singular that this
verse should ever have been cited as prohibiting such
an alliance. No words could well be more explicit
than those which we have here, in limiting the application
of the prohibition to the life-time of the wife:
"Thou shalt not take a woman to her sister, <em>to be a rival
to her</em>, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other <em>in her
life time</em>" (R.V.). The law therefore does not touch
the question for which it is so often cited, but was
evidently only intended as a restriction on prevalent
polygamy. Polygamy is ever likely to produce
jealousies and heart-burnings; but it is plain that this
phase of the evil would reach its most extreme and
odious expression when the new and rival wife was
a sister to the one already married; when it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
practically annul sisterly love, and give rise to such
painful and peculiarly humiliating dissensions as we
read of between the sisters Leah and Rachel. The
sense of the passage is so plain, that we are told that
this interpretation "stood its ground unchallenged from
the third century <small>B.C.</small> to the middle of the sixteenth
century <em>A.D.</em>" Whatever opinion any may hold therefore
as to the expediency, upon other grounds, of this
much debated alliance, this passage, certainly, cannot be
fairly cited as forbidding it; but is far more naturally
understood as by natural implication permitting the
union, after the decease of the first wife. The laws
concerning incest therefore terminate with ver. 17;
and ver. 18, according to this interpretation, must be
regarded as a restriction upon polygamous connections,
as ver. 19 is upon the rights of marriage.</p>

<p>It seems somewhat surprising that the question
should have been raised, even theoretically, whether
the Mosaic law, as regards the degrees of affinity prohibited
in marriage, is of permanent authority. The
reasons for these prohibitions, wherever given, are as
valid now as then; for the simple reason that they are
grounded fundamentally in a matter of fact,&mdash;namely,
the nature of the relation between husband and wife,
whereby they become "one flesh," implied in such
phraseology as we find in ver. 16; and also the relation
of blood between members of the same family, as in
vv. 10, etc. Happily, however, whatever theory any
may have held, the Church in all ages has practically
recognised every one of these prohibitions, as binding
on all persons; and has rather been inclined to err, if
at all, by extending, through inference and analogy,
the prohibited degrees even beyond the Mosaic code.
So much, however, by way of guarding against excess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
in such inferential extensions of the law, we must
certainly say: according to the law itself, as further
applied in chap. xxi. 1-4, and limited in Deut. xxv. 5-10,
relationship by marriage is not to be regarded as precisely
equivalent in degree of affinity to relationship
by blood. We cannot, for instance, conceive that, under
any circumstances, the prohibition of the marriage of
brothers and sisters should have had any exception;
and yet, as we have seen, the marriage between brother
and sister-in-law is explicitly authorised, in the case
of the levirate marriage, and by implication allowed in
other cases, by the language of ver. 18 of this chapter.</p>

<p>But in these days, when there is such a manifest
inclination in Christendom, as especially in the United
States and in France, to ignore the law of God in
regard to marriage and divorce, and regulate these
instead by a majority vote, it assuredly becomes
peculiarly imperative that, as Christians, we exercise a
holy jealousy for the honour of God and the sanctity
of the family, and ever refuse to allow a majority vote
any authority in these matters, where it contravenes
the law of God. While we must observe caution that
in these things we lay no burden on the conscience of
any, which God has not first placed there, we must
insist&mdash;all the more strenuously because of the universal
tendency to license&mdash;upon the strict observance of all
that is either explicitly taught or by necessary implication
involved in the teachings of God's Word upon this
question. Nothing more fundamentally concerns the
well-being of society than the relation of the man and
the woman in the constitution of the family; and
while, unfortunately, in our modern democratic communities,
the Church may not be able always to control
and determine the civil law in these matters, she can at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
least utterly refuse any compromise where the civil law
ignores what God has spoken; and with unwavering
firmness deny her sanction, in any way, to any connection
between a man and a woman which is not according
to the revealed will of God, as set before us in this
most holy, good, and beneficent law.</p>

<p>The chapter before us casts a light upon the moral
condition of the most cultivated heathen peoples in
those days, among whom many of the grossest of
these incestuous connections, as already remarked, were
quite common, even among those of the highest station.
There are many in our day more or less affected with
the present fashion of admiration for the ancient (and
modern) heathenisms, who would do well to heed this
light, that their blind enthusiasm might thereby be
somewhat tempered.</p>

<p>On the other hand, these laws show us, in a very
striking contrast, the estimate which God puts upon
the maintenance of holiness, purity, and chastity between
man and woman; and His very jealous regard
for the sanctity of the family in all its various relations.
Even in the Old Testament we have hints of a reason
for this, deeper than mere expediency,&mdash;hints which
receive a definite form in the clearer teaching of the New
Testament, which tells us that in the Divine plan it is
ordained that in these earthly relations man shall be the
shadow and image of God. If, as the Apostle tells us
(Eph. iii. 15, R.V.), "every family in heaven and on
earth" is named from the Father; and if, as he again
teaches (Eph. v. 29-32), the relation of husband and
wife is intended to be an earthly type and symbol of
the relation between the Lord Jesus Christ and His
Church, which is His Bride,&mdash;then we cannot wonder
at the exceedingly strong emphasis which marks these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
prohibitions. Everything must be excluded which
would be incompatible with this holy ideal of God for
man; that not only in the constitution of his person,
but in these sacred relations which belong to his very
nature, as created male and female, he should be the
image of the invisible God.</p>

<p>Thus, he who is a father is ever to bear in mind
that in his fatherhood he is appointed to shadow forth
the ineffable mystery of the eternal relation of the only-begotten
and most holy Son to this everlasting Father.
As husband, the man is to remember that since he
who is joined to his wife becomes with her "one flesh,"
therefore this union becomes, in the Divine ordination,
a type and pattern of the yet more mysterious union
of life between the Son of God and the Church, which
is His Bride. As brothers and sisters, again, the
children of God are to remember that brotherly love, in
its purity and unselfish devotion, is intended of God to
be a living illustration of the love of Him who has
been made of God to be "the firstborn among many
brethren" (Rom. viii. 29). And thus, with the family
life pervaded through and through by these ideas,
will license and impurity be made impossible, and, as
happily now in many a Christian home, it will appear
that the family, no less truly than the Church, is appointed
of God to be a sanctuary of purity in a world
impure and corrupt by wicked works, and, no less
really than the Church, to be an effective means of
Divine grace, and of preparation for the eternal life of
the heavenly kingdom, when all of God's "many sons"
shall have been brought to glory, the "many brethren"
of the First-Begotten, to abide with Him in the Father's
house for ever and ever.</p>

<p>After the prohibition of adultery in ver. 20, we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
what at first seems like a very abrupt introduction of a
totally different subject; for ver. 21 refers, not to the
seventh, but to the second, and, therewith also, to the
sixth commandment. It reads: "Thou shalt not give
any of thy seed to make them pass through the fire to
Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God."</p>

<p>But the connection of thought is found in the historical
relation of the licentious practices prohibited in the
preceding verses to idolatry, of which this Molech-worship
is named as one of the most hideous manifestations.
Some, indeed, have supposed that this frequently
recurring phrase does not designate an actual sacrifice
of the children, but only their consecration to Molech
by some kind of fire-baptism. But certainly such
passages as 2 Kings xvii. 31, Jer. vii. 31, xix. 5, distinctly
require us to understand an actual offering of
the children as "burnt-offerings." They were not
indeed burnt alive, as a late and untrustworthy tradition
has it, but were first slain, as in the case of all burnt-sacrifices,
and then burnt. The unnatural cruelty of
the sacrifice, even as thus made, was such, that both
here and in xx. 3 it is described as in a special sense
a "profaning" of God's holy name,&mdash;a profanation, in
that it represented Him, the Lord of love and fatherly
mercy, as requiring such a cruel and unnatural sacrifice
of parental love, in the immolation of innocent children.</p>

<p>The inconceivably unnatural crimes prohibited in
vv. 22, 23 were in like manner essentially connected
with idolatrous worship: the former with the worship
of Astarte or Ashtoreth; the latter with the worship
of the he-goat at Mendes in Egypt, as the symbol
of the generative power in nature. What a hideous
perversion of the moral sense was involved in these
crimes, as thus connected with idolatrous worship, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
illustrated strikingly by the fact that men and women,
thus prostituted to the service of false gods, were
designated by the terms <i>qádesh</i> and <i>qádesháh</i>, "sacred,"
"holy"!<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> No wonder that the sacred writer brands
these horrible crimes as, in a peculiar and almost
solitary sense, "abomination," "confusion."</p>

<p>In these days of ours, when it has become the
fashion among a certain class of cultured writers&mdash;who
would still, in many instances, apparently desire to be
called Christian&mdash;to act as the apologists of idolatrous,
and, according to Holy Scripture, false religions, the
mention of these crimes in this connection may well
remind the reader of what such seem to forget, as
they certainly ignore; namely, that in all ages, in
the modern heathenism no less than in the ancient,
idolatry and gross licentiousness ever go hand in hand.
Still, to-day, even in Her Majesty's Indian Empire, is
the most horrible licentiousness practised as an office
of religious worship. Nor are such revolting perversions
of the moral sense confined to the "Maharájás" of
the temples in Western India, who figured in certain
trials in Bombay a few years ago; for even the
modern "reformed" Hindooism, from which some
hope so much, has not always been able to shake itself
free from the pollution of these things, as witness
the argument conducted in recent numbers of the
<i>Árya Patriká</i> of Lahore, to justify the infamous custom
known as <i>Niyoga</i>, practised to this day in India, <em>e.g.</em>,
by the Panday Brahmans of Allahabad;&mdash;a practice
which is sufficiently described as being adultery
arranged for, under certain conditions, by a wife or
husband, the one for the other. One would fain charitably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
hope, if possible, that our modern apologists for
Oriental idolatries are unaccountably ignorant of what
all history should have taught them as to the inseparable
connection between idolatry and licentiousness.
Both Egypt and Canaan, in the olden time,&mdash;as this
chapter with all contemporaneous history teaches,&mdash;and
also India in modern times, read us a very awful
lesson on this subject. Not only have these idolatries
led too often to gross licentiousness of life, but in their
full development they have, again and again, in audacious
and blasphemous profanation of the most holy
God, and defiance even of the natural conscience, given
to the most horrible excesses of unbridled lust the
supreme sanction of declaring them to be religious
obligations. Assuredly, in God's sight, it cannot be a
trifling thing for any man, even through ignorance, to
extol, or even apologise for, religions with which such
enormities are both logically and historically connected.
And so, in these stern prohibitions, and their heavy
penal sanctions, we may find a profitable lesson for even
the cultivated intellect of the nineteenth century!</p>

<p>The chapter closes with reiterated charges against
indulgence in any of these abominations. Israel is told
(vv. 25, 28) that it was because the Canaanites practised
these enormities that God was about to scourge them
out of their land;&mdash;a judicial reason which, one would
think, should have some weight with those whose sympathies
are so drawn out with commiseration for the
Canaanites, that they find it impossible to believe that
it can be true, as we are told in the Pentateuch,
that God ordered their extermination. Rather, in the
light of the facts, would we raise the opposite question:
whether, if God indeed be a holy and righteous
Governor among the nations, He could do anything else<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
either in justice toward the Canaanites, or in mercy
toward those whom their horrible example would
certainly in like manner corrupt, than, in one way or
another, effect the extermination of such a people?</p>

<p>Israel is then solemnly warned (ver. 28) that if they,
notwithstanding, shall practise these crimes, God will
not spare them any more than He spared the Canaanites.
No covenant of His with them shall hinder the
land from spueing them out in like manner. And
though the nation, as a whole, give not itself to these
things, each individual is warned (ver. 29), "Whosoever
shall commit any of these abominations, even the
souls that do them shall be cut off from among their
people;" that is, shall be outlawed and shut out from
all participation in covenant mercies. And therewith
this part of the law of holiness closes, with those
pregnant words, repeated now in this chapter for the
fifth time: "I am the Lord (Heb. Jehovah) your
God!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</a></h2>

<h3><em>THE LAW OF HOLINESS (CONCLUDED).</em></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lev.</span> xix. 1-37.</p>


<p>We have in this chapter a series of precepts
and prohibitions which from internal evidence
appear to have been selected by an inspired redactor
of the canon from various original documents, with the
purpose, not of presenting a complete enumeration of
all moral and ceremonial duties, but of illustrating the
application in the everyday life of the Israelite of the
injunction which stands at the beginning of the chapter
(ver. 2): "Ye shall be holy: for I the Lord your God
am holy."</p>

<p>Truly strange it is, in the full light of Hebrew history,
to find any one, like Kalisch, representing this
conception of holiness, so fundamental to this law,
as the "ripest fruit of Hebrew culture"! For it is
insisted by such competent critics, as Dillmann, that we
have not in this chapter a late development of Hebrew
thought, but "ancient," "the most ancient" material;<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>&mdash;we
shall venture to say, dating even from the days of
Moses, as is declared in ver. 1. And we may say more.
For if such be the antiquity of this law, it should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
easy even for the most superficial reader of the history
to see how immeasurably far was that horde of almost
wholly uncultured fugitives from Egyptian bondage from
having attained through any culture this Mosaic conception
of holiness. For "Hebrew culture," even in its
latest maturity, has, at the best, only tended to develop
more and more the idea, not of holiness, but of legality,&mdash;a
very different thing! The ideal expressed in
this command, "Ye shall be holy," must have come,
not from Israel, not even from Moses, as if originated
by him, but from the Holy God Himself, even as the
chapter in its first verse testifies.</p>

<p>The position of this command at the head of the long
list of precepts which follows, is most significant and
instructive. It sets before us the object of the whole
ceremonial and moral law, and, we may add, the
supreme object of the Gospel also, namely, to produce a
certain type of moral and spiritual character, a <small>HOLY</small>
manhood; it, moreover, precisely interprets this term,
so universally misunderstood and misapplied among all
nations, as essentially consisting in a spiritual likeness
to God: "Ye shall be holy: for I the Lord your God
am holy." These words evidently at once define holiness
and declare the supreme motive to the attainment
and maintenance of a holy character. This then is
brought before us as the central thought in which all
the diverse precepts and prohibitions which follow find
their unity; and, accordingly, we find this keynote
of the whole law echoing, as it were, all through this
chapter, in the constant refrain, repeated herein no less
than fourteen&mdash;twice seven&mdash;times: "I am the Lord
(Heb. Jehovah)!" "I am the Lord your God!"</p>

<p>The first division of the law of holiness which follows
(vv. 3-8), deals with two duties of fundamental importance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
in the social and the religious life: the one,
honour to parents; the other, reverence to God.</p>

<p>If we are surprised, at first, to see this place of
honour in the law of holiness given to the fifth commandment
(ver. 3), our surprise will lessen when we
remember how, taking the individual in the development
of his personal life, he learns to fear God, first of
all, through fearing and honouring his parents. In the
earliest beginnings of life, the parent&mdash;to speak with
reverence&mdash;stands to his child, in a very peculiar sense,
for and in the place of God. We gain the conception
of the Father in heaven first from our experience of
fatherhood on earth; and so it may be said of this
commandment, in a sense in which it cannot be said
of any other, that it is the foundation of all religion.
Alas for the child who contemns the instruction of his
father and the command of his mother! for by so doing
he puts himself out of the possibility of coming into
the knowledge and experience of the Fatherhood of
God.</p>

<p>The principle of reverence toward God is inculcated,
not here by direct precept, but by three injunctions,
obedience to which presupposes the fear of God in
the heart. These are, first (ver. 3), the keeping of the
sabbaths; the possessive, "My sabbaths," reminding
us tersely of God's claim upon the seventh part of all our
time as His time. Then is commanded the avoidance
of idolatry (ver. 4); and, lastly (vv. 5-8), a charge as
to the observance of the law of the peace-offering.</p>

<p>One reason seems to have determined the selection
of each of these three injunctions, namely, that Israel
would be more liable to fail in obedience to these than
perhaps any other duties of the law. As for the
sabbath, this, like the law of the peace-offering, was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
positive, not a moral law; that is, it depended for its
authority primarily on the explicit ordinance of God,
instead of the intuition of the natural conscience.
Hence it was certain that it would only be kept in so
far as man retained a vivid consciousness of the Divine
personality and moral authority. Moreover, as all
history has shown, the law of the sabbath rest from
labour constantly comes into conflict with man's love
of gain and eager haste to make money. It is a life-picture,
true for men of every generation, when Amos
(viii. 5) brings before us the Israelites of his day as
saying, in their insatiate worldly greed, "When will
the sabbath be gone, that we may set forth wheat?"
As regards the selection of the second commandment,
one can easily see that Israel's loyalty, surrounded as
they were on every side with idolaters, was to be
tested with peculiar severity on this point, whether
they would indeed worship the living God alone and
without the intervention of idols.</p>

<p>The circumstances, as regards the peace-offering,
were different; but the same principle of choice can
be discovered in this also. For among all the various
ordinances of sacrificial worship there was none in
which the requisitions of the law were more likely
to be neglected; partly because these were the most
frequent of all offerings, and also because the Israelite
would often be tempted, through a short-sighted
economy and worldly thriftiness, to use the meat of
the peace-offering for food, if any remained until the
third day, instead of burning it, in such case, as the
Lord commanded. Hence the reminder of the law on
this subject, teaching that he who will be holy must
not seek to save at the expense of obedience to the
holy God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span></p>

<p>The second section of this chapter (vv. 9-18) consists
of five groups, each of five precepts, all relating
to duties which the law of holiness requires from man
to man, and each of them closing with the characteristic
and impressive refrain, "I am the Lord."</p>

<p>The first of these pentads (vv. 9, 10) requires
habitual care for the poor: we read, "Thou shalt not
wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou
gather the gleaning of thy harvest. And thou shalt not
glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather the fallen
fruit of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the
poor and for the stranger."</p>

<p>The law covers the three chief products of their
agriculture: the grain, the product of the vine, and
the fruit of the trees,&mdash;largely olive-trees, which were
often planted in the vineyard. So often as God blessed
them with the harvest, they were to remember the
poor, and also "the stranger," who according to the
law could have a legal claim to no land in Israel.
Apart from the benefit to the poor, one can readily see
what an admirable discipline against man's natural
selfishness, and in loyalty to God, this regulation,
faithfully observed, must have been. Behind these
commands lies the principle, elsewhere explicitly expressed
(xxv. 23), that the land which the Israelite
tilled was not his own, but the Lord's; and it is as
the Owner of the land that He thus charges them that
as His tenants they shall not regard themselves as
entitled to everything that the land produces, but bear
in mind that He intends a portion of every acre of
each Israelite to be reserved for the poor. And so the
labourer in the harvest-field was continually reminded
that in his husbandry he was merely God's steward,
bound to apply the product of the land, the use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
which was given him, in such a way as should please
the Lord.</p>

<p>If the law is not in force as to the letter, let us not
forget that it is of full validity as to its spirit. God
is still the God of the poor and needy; and we are
still every one, as truly as the Hebrew in those days,
the stewards of God. And the poor we have with
us always; perhaps never more than in these days,
in which so great masses of helpless humanity are
crowded together in our immense cities, did the cry
of the poor and needy so ascend to heaven. And
that the Apostles, acting under Divine direction, and
abolishing the letter of the theocratic law, yet steadily
maintained the spirit and intention of that law in care
for the poor, is testified with abundant fulness in the
New Testament. One of the firstfruits of Pentecost
in the lives of believers was just this, that "all that
believed ... had all things common" (Acts ii. 44, 45),
so that, going even beyond the letter of the old law,
"they sold their possessions and goods, and parted them
to all, according as any man had need." And the one
only charge which the Apostles at Jerusalem gave unto
Paul is reported by him in these words (Gal. ii. 10):
"Only they would that we should remember the
poor; which very thing I was also zealous to do." Let
the believer then remember this who has plenty: the
corners of his fields are to be kept for the poor, and
the gleanings of his vineyards; and let the believer
also take the peculiar comfort from this law, if he is
poor, that God, his heavenly Father, has a kindly care,
not merely for his spiritual wants, but also for his
temporal necessities.</p>

<p>The second pentad (vv. 11, 12) in the letter refers
to three of the ten commandments, but is really concerned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
primarily, with stealing and defrauding; for
the lying and false swearing is here regarded only
as commonly connected with theft and fraud, because
often necessary to secure the result of a man's plunder.
The pentad is in this form: "Ye shall not steal;
neither shall ye deal falsely, nor lie one to another.
And ye shall not swear by My name falsely, so that
thou profane the name of thy God: I am the Lord!"</p>

<p>Close upon stinginess and the careless greed which
neglects the poor, with eager grasping after the last
grape on the vine, follows the active effort to get, not
only the uttermost that might by any stretch of charity
be regarded as our own, but also to get something more
that belongs to our neighbour. There is thus a very
close connection in thought, as well as in position,
in these two groups of precepts. And the sequence
of thought in this group suggests what is, indeed,
markedly true of stealing, but also of other sins. Sin
rarely goes alone; one sin, by almost a necessity,
leads straight on to another sin. He who steals, or
deals falsely in regard to anything committed to his
trust, will most naturally be led on at once to lie about
it; and when his lie is challenged, as it is likely to be,
he is impelled by a fatal pressure to go yet further,
and fortify his lie, and consummate his sin, by
appealing by an oath to the Holy God, as witness
to the truth of his lie. Thus, the sin which in the
beginning is directed only toward a fellow-man, too
often causes one to sin immediately against God, in
profanation of the name of the God of truth, by calling
on Him as witness to a lie! Of this tendency of
sin, stealing is a single illustration; but let us ever
remember that it is a law of all sin that sin ever
begets more sin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span></p>

<p>This second group has dealt with injury to the
neighbour in the way of guile and fraud; the third
pentad (vv. 13, 14), progressing further, speaks of
wrong committed in ways of oppression and violence.
"Thou shalt not oppress thy neighbour, nor rob him:
the wages of a hired servant shall not abide with
thee all night until the morning. Thou shalt not curse
the deaf, nor put a stumbling-block before the blind,
but thou shalt fear thy God: I am the Lord!" In
these commands, again, it is still the helpless and
defenceless in whose behalf the Lord is speaking.
The words regard a man as having it in his power to
press hard upon his neighbour; as when an employer,
seeing that a man must needs have work at any price,
takes advantage of his need to employ him at less than
fair wages; or as when he who holds a mortgage
against his neighbour, seeing an opportunity to possess
himself of a field or an estate for a trifle, by pressing
his technical legal rights, strips his poor debtor needlessly.
No end of illustrations, evidently, could be
given out of our modern life. Man's nature is the
same now as in the days of Moses. But all dealings
of this kind, whether then or now, the law of holiness
sternly prohibits.</p>

<p>So also with the injunction concerning the retention
of wages after it is due. I have not fulfilled the law
of love toward the man or woman whom I employ
merely by paying fair wages; I must also pay promptly.
The Deuteronomic law repeats the command, and, with
a peculiar touch of sympathetic tenderness, adds the
reason (xxiv. 15): "for he is poor, and setteth his
heart upon it." I must therefore give the labourer
his wages "in his day." A sin this is, of the rich
especially, and, most of all, of rich corporations, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
which the sense of personal responsibility to God is
too often reduced to a minimum. Yet it is often,
no doubt, committed through sheer thoughtlessness.
Men who are themselves blessed with such abundance
that they are not seriously incommoded by a delay in
receiving some small sum, too often forget how a
great part of the poor live, as the saying is, "from
hand to mouth," so that the failure to get what is due
to them at the exact time appointed is frequently a sore
trial; and, moreover, by forcing them to buy on credit
instead of for cash, of necessity increases the expense
of their living, and so really robs them of that which
is their own.</p>

<p>The thought is still of care for the helpless, in the
words concerning the deaf and the blind, which, of
course, are of perpetual force, and, in the principle
involved, reach indefinitely beyond these single illustrations.
We are not to take advantage of any man's
helplessness, and, especially, of such disabilities as he
cannot help, to wrong him. Even the common conscience
of men recognises this as both wicked and
mean; and this verdict of conscience is here emphasised
by the reminder "I am the Lord,"&mdash;suggesting that the
labourer who reaps the fields, yea, the blind also and
the deaf, are His creatures; and that He, the merciful
and just One, will not disown the relation, but will
plead their cause.</p>

<p>Each of these groups of precepts has kept the poor
and the needy in a special way, though not exclusively,
before the conscience. And yet no man is to imagine
that therefore God will be partial toward the poor, and
that hence, although one may not wrong the poor,
one may wrong the rich with impunity. Many of our
modern social reformers, in their zeal for the betterment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
of the poor, seem to imagine that because a poor
man has rights which are too frequently ignored by
the rich, and thus often suffers grievous wrongs, therefore
a rich man has no rights which the poor man is
bound to respect. The next pentad of precepts therefore
guards against any such false inference from God's
special concern for the poor, and reminds us that the
absolute righteousness of the Holy One requires that
the rights of the rich be observed no less than the
rights of the poor, those of the employer no less than
those of the employed. It deals especially with this
matter as it comes up in questions requiring legal
adjudication. We read (vv. 15, 16), "Ye shall do no
unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect
the person of the poor, nor honour the person of the
mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy
neighbour. Thou shalt not go up and down as a
talebearer among thy people: neither shalt thou stand
against the blood of thy neighbour: I am the Lord!"</p>

<p>A plain warning lies here for an increasing class of
reformers in our day, who loudly express their special
concern for the poor, but who in their zeal for social
reform and the diminishing of poverty are forgetful of
righteousness and equity. It applies, for instance, to
all who would affirm and teach with Marx that "capital
is robbery;" or who, not yet quite ready for so plain
and candid words, yet would, in any way, in order to
right the wrongs of the poor, advocate legislation
involving practical confiscation of the estates of the
rich.</p>

<p>In close connection with the foregoing, the next
precept forbids, not precisely "tale-bearing," but
"slander," as the word is elsewhere rendered, even in
the Revised Version. In the court of judgment, slander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
is not to be uttered nor listened to. The clause which
follows is obscure; but means either, "Thou shalt
not, by such slanderous testimony, seek in the court
of judgment thy neighbour's life," which best suits the
parallelism; or, perhaps, as the Talmud and most
modern Jewish versions interpret, "Thou shalt not
stand silent by, when thy neighbour's life is in danger
in the court of judgment, and thy testimony might save
him." And then again comes in the customary refrain,
reminding the Israelite that in every court, noting
every act of judgment, and listening to every witness,
is a Judge unseen, omniscient, absolutely righteous,
under whose final review, for confirmation or reversal,
shall come all earthly decisions: "I," who thus speak,
"am the Lord!"</p>

<p>The fifth and last pentad (vv. 17, 18) fitly closes
the series, by its five precepts, of which, three, reaching
behind all such outward acts as are required or forbidden
in the foregoing, deal with the state of the heart
toward our neighbour which the law of holiness requires,
as the soul and the root of all righteousness.
It closes with the familiar words, so simple that all
can understand them, so comprehensive that in obedience
to them is comprehended all morality and righteousness
toward man: "Thou shalt love thy neighbour
as thyself." The verses read, "Thou shalt not hate
thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt surely rebuke
thy neighbour, and not bear sin because of him. Thou
shalt not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against
the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy
neighbour as thyself: I am the Lord!"</p>

<p>Most instructive it is to find it suggested by this
order, as the best evidence of the absence of hate, and
the truest expression of love to our neighbour, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
when we see him doing wrong we shall rebuke him.
The Apostle Paul has enjoined upon Christians the
same duty, indicating also the spirit in which it is to
be performed (Gal. vi. 1): "Brethren, even if a man
be overtaken in any trespass, ye which are spiritual,
restore such a one in a spirit of meekness; looking to
thyself, lest thou also be tempted." Thus, if we will
be holy, it is not to be a matter of no concern to us
that our neighbour does wrong, even though that wrong
do not directly affect our personal well-being. Instead
of this, we are to remember that if we rebuke him not,
we ourselves "bear sin, because of him;" that is, we
ourselves, in a degree, become guilty with him, because
of that wrong-doing of his which we sought not in any
way to hinder. But although, on the one hand, I am
to rebuke the wrong-doer, even when his wrong does
not touch me personally, yet, the law adds, I am not to
take into my own hands the avenging of wrongs, even
when myself injured; neither am I to be envious and
grudge any neighbour the good he may have; no, not
though he be an ill-doer and deserve it not; but be he
friend or foe, well-doer or ill-doer, I must love him as
myself.</p>

<p>What an admirable epitome of the whole law of
righteousness! a Mosaic anticipation of the very spirit
of the Sermon on the Mount. Evidently, the same
mind speaks in both alike; the law the same, the
object and aim of the law the same, both in Leviticus
and in the Gospel. In this law we hear: "Ye shall
be holy: for I the Lord your God am holy;" in the
Sermon on the Mount: "Ye shall be perfect, as your
heavenly Father is perfect."</p>

<p>The third division of this chapter (vv. 19-32) opens
with a general charge to obedience: "Ye shall keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
My statutes;" very possibly, because several of the
commands which immediately follow might seem in
themselves of little consequence, and so be lightly
disobeyed. The law of ver. 19 prohibits raising hybrid
animals, as, for example, mules; the next command
apparently refers to the chance, through sowing a field
with mingled seed, of giving rise to hybrid forms in the
vegetable kingdom. The last command in this verse
is obscure both in meaning and intention. It reads
(R.V.), "Neither shall there come upon thee a garment
of two kinds of stuff mingled together." Most probably
the reference is to different materials, interwoven in the
yarn of which the dress was made; but a difficulty
still remains in the fact that such admixture was
ordered in the garments of the priests. Perhaps the
best explanation is that of Josephus, that the law here
was only intended for the laity; which, as no question
of intrinsic morality was involved, might easily have
been. But when we inquire as to the reason of these
prohibitions, and especially of this last one, it must be
confessed that it is hard for us now to speak with
confidence. Most probable it appears that they were
intended for an educational purpose, to cultivate in
the mind of the people the sentiment of reverence for
the order established in nature by God. For what the
world calls the order of nature is really an order
appointed by God, as the infinitely wise and perfect
One; hence, as nature is thus a manifestation of God,
the Hebrew was forbidden to seek to bring about that
which is not according to nature, unnatural commixtures;
and from this point of view, the last of the
three precepts appears to be a symbolic reminder of
the same duty, namely, reverence for the order of
nature, as being an order determined by God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span></p>

<p>The law which is laid down in vv. 20-22, regarding
the sin of connection with a bond-woman betrothed
to a husband, apparently refers to such a case as is
mentioned in Exod. xxi. 7, 8, where the bond-maid
is betrothed to her master, while yet, because of her
condition of bondage, the marriage has not been consummated.
For the same sin in the case of a free woman,
where both were proved guilty, for each of them the
punishment was death (Deut. xxii. 23, 24). In this
case, because the woman's position, inasmuch as she
was not free, was rather that of a concubine than of a
full wife, the lighter penalty of scourging is ordered
for both of the guilty persons. Also, since this was a
case of trespass as well, in which the rights of the
master to whom she was espoused were involved, a
guilt-offering was in addition required, as the condition
of pardon.</p>

<p>It will be said, and truly, that by this law slavery
and concubinage are to a certain extent recognised by
the law; and upon this fact has been raised an objection
bearing on the holiness of the law-giver, and, by
consequence, on the Divine origin and inspiration of
the law. Is it conceivable that the holy God should
have given a law for the regulation of two so evil
institutions? The answer has been furnished us, in
principle, by our Lord (Matt. xix. 8), in that which He
said concerning the analogous case of the law of Moses
touching divorce; which law, He tells us, although not
according to the perfect ideal of right, was yet given
"because of the hardness of men's hearts." That is,
although it was not the best law ideally, it was the
best practically, in view of the low moral tone of the
people to whom it was given. Precisely so it was in
this case. Abstractly, one might say that the case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
was in nothing different from the case of a free woman,
mentioned Deut. xxii. 23, 24, for which death was the
appointed punishment; but practically, in a community
where slavery and concubinage were long-settled institutions,
and the moral standard was still low, the cases
were not parallel. A law which would carry with it
the moral support of the people in the one case, and
which it would thus be possible to carry into effect,
would not be in like manner supported and carried into
effect in the other; so that the result of greater strictness
in theory would, in actual practice, be the removal
thereby of all restriction on license. On the other
hand, by thus appointing herein a penalty for both the
guilty parties such as the public conscience would
approve, God taught the Hebrews the fundamental
lesson that a slave-girl is not regarded by God as a
mere chattel; and that if, because of the hardness of
their hearts, concubinage was tolerated for a time, still
the slave-girl must not be treated as a thing, but as a
person, and indiscriminate license could not be permitted.
And thus, it is of greatest moment to observe, a principle
was introduced into the legislation, which in its
ultimate logical application would require and effect&mdash;as
in due time it has&mdash;the total abolition of the institution
of slavery wherever the authority of the living
God is truly recognised.</p>

<p>The principle of the Divine government which is here
illustrated is one of exceeding practical importance as a
model for us. We live in an age when, everywhere in
Christendom, the cry is "Reform;" and there are many
who think that if once it be proved that a thing is wrong,
it follows by necessary consequence that the immediate
and unqualified legal prohibition of that wrong, under
such penalty as the wrong may deserve, is the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
thing that any Christian man has a right to think of.
And yet, according to the principle illustrated in this legislation,
this conclusion in such cases can by no means
be taken for granted. That is not always the best law
practically which is the best law abstractly. That law
is the best which shall be most effective in diminishing
a given evil, under the existing moral condition of the
community; and it is often a matter of such exceeding
difficulty to determine what legislation against admitted
sins and evils, may be the most productive of good in a
community whose moral sense is dull concerning them,
that it is not strange that the best of men are often
found to differ. Remembering this, we may well commend
the duty of a more charitable judgment, in such
cases, than one often hears from such radical reformers,
who seem to imagine that in order to remove an evil
all that is necessary is to pass a law at once and for ever
prohibiting it; and who therefore hold up to obloquy
all who doubt as to the wisdom and duty of so doing,
as the enemies of truth and of righteousness. Moses,
acting under direct instruction from the God of supreme
wisdom and of perfect holiness, was far wiser than such
well-meaning but sadly mistaken social reformers, who
would fain be wiser than God.</p>

<p>Next follows a law (vv. 23-25) directing that when
any fruit tree is planted, the Israelite shall not eat of its
fruit for the first three years; that the fruit of the fourth
year shall be wholly consecrated to the Lord, "for giving
praise unto Jehovah;" and that only after that, in the
fifth year of its bearing, shall the husbandman himself
first eat of its fruit.</p>

<p>The explanation of this peculiar regulation is to be
found in a special application of the principle which
rules throughout the law; that the first-fruit, whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
the first-born of man or beast, or the first-fruits of the
field, shall always be consecrated unto God. But in this
case the application of the principle is modified by the
familiar fact that the fruit of a young tree, for the first
few years of its bearing, is apt to be imperfect; it is not
yet sufficiently grown to yield its best possible product.
Because of this, in those years it could not be given to
the Lord, for He must never be served with any but the
best of everything; and thus until the fruit should reach
its best, so as to be worthy of presentation to the Lord,
the Israelite was meanwhile debarred from using it.
During these three years the trees are said to be "as
uncircumcised;" <em>i.e.</em>, they were to be regarded as in a
condition analogous to that of the child who has not
yet been consecrated, by the act of circumcision, to the
Lord. In the fourth year, however, the trees were
regarded as having now so grown as to yield fruit in
perfection; hence, the principle of the consecration of
the first-fruit now applies, and all the fourth year's
product is given to the Lord, as an offering of thankful
praise to Him whose power in nature is the secret of all
growth, fruitfulness, and increase. The last words of
this law, "that it may yield unto you its increase,"
evidently refer to all that precedes. Israel is to obey
this law, using nothing till first consecrated to the Lord,
in order to a blessing in these very gifts of God.</p>

<p>The moral teaching of this law, when it is thus read
in the light of the general principle of the consecration
of the first-fruits, is very plain. It teaches, as in all
analogous cases, that God is always to be served before
ourselves; and that not grudgingly, as if an irksome
tax were to be paid to the Majesty of heaven, but in the
spirit of thanksgiving and praise to Him, as the Giver of
"every good and perfect gift." It further instructs us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
in this particular instance, that the people of God are
to recognise this as being true even of all those good
things which come to us under the forms of products of
nature.</p>

<p>The lesson is not an easy one for faith; for the
constant tendency, never stronger than in our own
time, is to substitute "Nature" for the God of nature,
as if nature were a power in itself and apart from God,
immanent in all nature, the present and efficient energy
in all her manifold operations. Very fittingly, thus, do
we find here again (ver. 25) the sanction affixed to
this law, "I am the Lord your God!" Jehovah, your
God who redeemed you, who therefore am worthy of
all thanksgiving and praise! Jehovah, your God in
covenant, who gives the fruitful seasons, filling your
hearts with joy and gladness! Jehovah, your God, who
as the Lord of Nature, and the Power in nature, am
abundantly able to fulfil the promise affixed to this
command!</p>

<p>The next six commands are evidently grouped together
as referring to various distinctively heathenish customs,
from which Israel, as a people holy to the Lord, was to
abstain. The prohibition of blood (ver. 26) is repeated
again, not, as has been said, in a stronger form than
before, but, probably, because the eating of blood was
connected with certain heathenish ceremonies, both
among the Shemitic tribes and others. The next two
precepts (ver. 26) prohibit every kind of divination and
augury; practices notoriously common with the heathen
everywhere, in ancient and in modern times. The two
precepts which follow, forbidding certain fashions of
trimming the hair and beard, may appear trivial to
many, but they will not seem so to any one who will
remember how common among heathen peoples has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
been the custom, as in those days among the Arabs,
and in our time among the Hindoos, to trim the hair or
beard in a particular way, in order thus visibly to mark
a person as of a certain religion, or as a worshipper of
a certain god. The command means that the Israelite
was not only to worship God alone, but he was not to
adopt a fashion in dress which, because commonly
associated with idolatry, might thus misrepresent his
real position as a worshipper of the only living and
true God.</p>

<p>"Cutting the flesh for the dead" (ver. 28) has been
very widely practised by heathen peoples in all ages.
Such immoderate and unseemly expressions of grief
were prohibited to the Israelite, as unworthy of a
people who were in a blessed covenant relation with
the God of life and of death. Rather, recognising that
death is of God's ordination, he was to accept in
patience and humility the stroke of God's hand; not,
indeed, without sorrow, but yet in meekness and quietness
of spirit, trusting in the God of life. The thought
is only a less clear expression of the New Testament
word (1 Thess. iv. 13) that the believer "sorrow not,
even as the rest, which have no hope." Also, probably,
in this prohibition, as certainly in the next (ver. 28),
it is suggested that as the Israelite was to be distinguished
from the heathen by full consecration, not
only of the soul, but also of the body, to the Lord, he
was by that fact inhibited from marring or defacing in
any way the integrity of his body.</p>

<p>In general, we may say, then, that the central
thought which binds this group of precepts together,
is the obligation, not merely to abstain from everything
directly idolatrous, but also from all such customs
as are, in fact, rooted in or closely associated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
with idolatry. On the same principle, the Christian is
to beware of all fashions and practices, even though
they may be in themselves indifferent, which yet, as
a matter of fact, are specially characteristic of the
worldly and ungodly element in society. The principle
assumed in these prohibitions thus imposes upon all
who would be holy to the Lord, in all ages, a firm
restriction. The thoughtless desire of many, at any
risk, to be "in the fashion," must be unwaveringly
denied. The reason which is so often given by professing
Christians for indulgence in such cases, that
"all the world does so," may often be the strongest
possible reason for declining to follow the fashion.
No servant of God should ever be seen in any part
of the livery of Satan's servants. That God does not
think these "little things" always of trifling consequence,
we are reminded by the repetition here, for
the tenth time in this chapter, of the words, "I am
the Lord!"</p>

<p>Next (ver. 29) follows the prohibition of the horrible
custom, still practised among heathen peoples, of the
prostitution of a daughter by a parent. It is here
enforced by the consideration of the public weal: "lest
the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full
of wickedness." Assuredly, that a land in which such
harlotry as this, in which all the most sacred relations
of life are trampled in the mire, would be nothing less
than a land full of wickedness, is so evident as to
require no comment.</p>

<p>Herewith now begins the fourth and last division
of this chapter (vv. 30-37), with a repetition of the
injunction to keep the Sabbaths of the Lord, and
reverence His sanctuary. The emphasis on this command,
shown by its repetition in this chapter, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
very prominent place which it occupies both in the law
and the prophets, certainly suggests that in the mind
of God, reverence for the Sabbath and for the place
where God is worshipped, has much to do with the
promotion of holiness of life, and the maintenance of
a high degree of domestic and social morality. Nor
is it difficult to see why this should be so. For however
the day of holy rest may be kept, and the place
of Divine worship be regarded with only an outward
reverence by many, yet the fact cannot be disputed,
that the observance of a weekly sabbatic rest from
ordinary secular occupations, and the maintenance of
a spirit of reverence for sacred places or for sacred
times, has, and must have, a certain and most happy
tendency to keep the God of the Sabbath and the
God of the sanctuary before the mind of men, and
thus imposes an effective check upon unrestrained
godlessness and reckless excesses of iniquity. The
diverse condition of things in various parts of modern
Christendom, as related to the more or less careful
observance of the weekly religious rest, is full of both
instruction and warning to any candid mind upon this
subject. There is no restraint on immorality like the
frequent remembrance of God and the spirit of reverence
for Him.</p>

<p>Verse 31 prohibits all inquiring of them that "have
familiar spirits," and of "wizards," who pretend to
make revelations through the help of supernatural
powers. According to 1 Sam. xxviii. 7-11, and Isa.
viii. 19, the "familiar spirit" is a supposed spirit of
a dead man, from whom one professes to be able to
give communications to the living. This pretended
commerce with the spirits of the dead has been common
enough in heathenism always, and it is not strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
to find it mentioned here, when Israel was to be in so
intimate relations with heathen peoples. But it is
truly most extraordinary that in Christian lands, as
especially in the United States of America, and that
in the full light, religious and intellectual, of the last
half of the nineteenth century, such a prohibition
should be fully as pertinent as in Israel! For no
words could more precisely describe the pretensions
of the so-called modern spiritualism, which within the
last half century has led away hundreds of thousands
of deluded souls, and those, in many cases, not from
the ignorant and degraded, but from circles which
boast of more than average culture and intellectual
enlightenment. And inasmuch as experience sadly
shows that even those who profess to be disciples of
Christ are in danger of being led away by our modern
wizards and traffickers with familiar spirits, it is by
no means unnecessary to observe that there is not the
slightest reason to believe that this which was rigidly
forbidden by God in the fifteenth century <small>B.C.</small>, can now
be well-pleasing to Him in the nineteenth century <small>A.D.</small>
And those who have most carefully watched the moral
developments of this latter-day delusion, will most
appreciate the added phrase which speaks of this as
"defiling" a man.</p>

<p>Verse 32 enjoins reverence for the aged, and closely
connects it with the fear of God. "Thou shalt rise
up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the
old man, and thou shalt fear thy God: I am the Lord."</p>

<p>A virtue this is which&mdash;it must be with shame
confessed&mdash;although often displayed in an illustrious
manner among the heathen, in many parts of Christendom
has sadly decayed. In many lands one only
needs to travel in any crowded conveyance to observe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
how far it is from the thoughts of many of the young
"to rise up before the hoary head, and honour the
face of the old man." So manifest are the facts that
one hears from competent and thoughtful observers
of the tendencies of our times no lamentation more
frequently than just this, for the concurrent decay of
reverence for the aged and reverence for God. No
more beautiful remarks on these words have we
found than the words quoted by Dr. H. Bonar, commenting
on this verse: "Lo! the shadow of eternity!
for one cometh who is almost in eternity already. His
head and his beard, white as snow, indicate his speedy
appearance before the Ancient of Days, the hair of
whose head is as pure wool."</p>

<p>In this last command is also, no doubt, contained
the thought of the comparative weakness and physical
infirmity of the aged, which is thus commended in a
special way to our tender regard. And thus this sentiment
of kindly sympathy for all who are subject to
any kind of disability naturally prepares the way for
the injunction (vv. 33, 34) to regard "the stranger"
in the midst of Israel, who was debarred from holding
land, and from many privileges, with special feelings
of good-will. "If a stranger sojourn with thee in your
land, ye shall not do him wrong. The stranger that
sojourneth with you shall be unto you as the home-born
among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself;
for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the
Lord your God."</p>

<p>The Israelite was not to misinterpret, then, the restrictions
which the theocratic law imposed upon such.
These might be no doubt necessary for a moral reason;
but, nevertheless, no man was to argue that the law
justified him in dealing hardly with aliens. So far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
from this, the Israelite was to regard the stranger with
the same kindly feelings as if he were one of his own
people. And it is most instructive to observe that this
particular case is made the occasion of repeating that
most perfect and comprehensive law of universal love,
"Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself;" and this
the more they were to do that they too had been
"strangers in the land of Egypt."</p>

<p>Last of all the injunctions in this chapter (vv. 35,
36) comes the command to absolute righteousness in
the administration of justice, and in all matters of
buying and selling; followed (ver. 37) by a concluding
charge to obedience, thus: "Ye shall do no unrighteousness
in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in
measure. Just balances, just weights, a just ephah,
and a just hin, shall ye have: I am the Lord your God,
which brought you out of the land of Egypt. And ye
shall observe all My statutes, and all My judgments,
and do them: I am the Lord."</p>

<p>The ephah is named here, of course, as a standard
of dry measure, and the hin as a standard of liquid
measure. These commandments are illustrated in a
graphic way by the parallel passage in Deut. xxv. 13,
14, which reads: "Thou shalt not have in thy bag
divers weights, a great and a small. Thou shalt not
have in thine house divers measures, a great and a
small;" <em>i.e.</em>, one set for use in buying, and another set
for use in selling. This charge is there enforced by
the same promise to honesty in trade which is annexed
to the fifth commandment, namely, length of days;
and, furthermore, by the declaration that all who thus
cheat in trade "are an abomination unto the Lord."</p>

<p>How much Israel needed this law all their history
has shown. In the days of Amos it was a part of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
charge against the ten tribes (viii. 5), for which the
Lord declares that He will "make the land to tremble,
and every one in it to mourn," that they "make the ephah
small, and the shekel great," and "deal falsely with
balances of deceit." So also Micah, a little later,
represents the Lord as calling Judah to account for
supposing that God, the Holy One, can be satisfied with
burnt-offerings and guilt-offerings; indignantly asking
(vi. 10, 11), "Are there yet the treasures of wickedness
in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure that
is abominable?"</p>

<p>But it is not Israel alone which has needed, and still
needs, to hear iterated this command, for the sin is
found in every people, even in every city, one might
say in every town, in Christendom; and&mdash;we have to
say it&mdash;often with men who make a certain profession
of regard for religion. All such, however religious in
certain ways, have special need to remember that
"without holiness no man shall see the Lord;" and
that holiness is now exactly what it was when the
Levitical law was given out. As, on the one side, it
is inspired by reverence and fear toward God, so, on
the other hand, it requires love to the neighbour as to
one's self, and such conduct as that will secure. It is
of no account, therefore, to keep the Sabbath&mdash;in a way&mdash;and
reverence&mdash;outwardly&mdash;the sanctuary, and then
on the week-day water milk, adulterate medicines,
sugars, and other foods, slip the yard-stick in measuring,
tip the balance in weighing, and buy with one
weight or measure and sell with another, "water"
stocks and gamble in "margins," as the manner of
many is. God hates, and even honest atheists despise,
religion of this kind. Strange notions, truly, of religion
have men who have not yet discovered that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
has to do with just such commonplace, every-day
matters as these, and have never yet understood how
certain it is that a religion which is only used on
Sundays has no holiness in it; and therefore, when
the day comes, as it is coming, that shall try every
man's work as by fire, it will, in the fierce heat of
Jehovah's judgment, be shrivelled into ashes as a
spider's web in a flame, and the man and his work
shall perish together.</p>

<p>And herewith this chapter closes. Such is the law
of holiness! Obligatory, let us not forget, in the spirit
of all its requirements, to-day, unchanged and unchangeable,
because the Holy God, whose law it is, is Himself
unchangeable. Man may be sinful, and because of sin
be weak; but there is not a hint of compromise with
sin, on this account, by any abatement of its claims.
At every step of life this law confronts us. Whether
we be in the House of God, in acts of worship, it
challenges us there; or in the field, at our work, it
commands us there; in social intercourse with our
fellow-men, in our business in bank or shop, with our
friends or with strangers and aliens, at home or abroad,
we are never out of the reach of its requirements. We
can no more escape from under its authority than
from under the overarching heaven! What sobering
thoughts are these for sinners! What self-humiliation
should this law cause us, when we think what we
are! what intensity of aspiration, when we think of
what the Holy One would have us be, holy like
Himself!</p>

<p>The closing words above given (ver. 37) assert the
authority of the Law-giver, and, by their reminder of
the great deliverance from Egypt, appeal, as a motive to
faithful and holy obedience, to the purest sentiment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
grateful love for undeserved and distinguishing mercy.
And this is only the Old Testament form of a New
Testament argument. For we read, concerning our
deliverance from a worse than Egyptian bondage (1
Peter i. 15-19): "Like as He which called you is holy,
be ye yourselves also holy in all manner of living;
because it is written, Ye shall be holy; for I am holy.
And if ye call on Him as Father, who without respect
of persons judgeth according to each man's work, pass
the time of your sojourning in fear: knowing that ye
were redeemed, not with corruptible things, as silver
or gold, ... but with precious blood, as of a lamb
without blemish and without spot, even the blood of
Christ."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</a></h2>

<h3><em>PENAL SANCTIONS.</em></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lev.</span> xx. 1-27.</p>


<p>In no age or community has it been found sufficient,
to secure obedience, that one should appeal to the
conscience of men, or depend, as a sufficient motive,
upon the natural painful consequences of violated law.
Wherever there is civil and criminal law, there, in all
cases, human government, whether in its lowest or in
its most highly developed forms, has found it necessary
to declare penalties for various crimes. It is the
peculiar interest of this chapter that it gives us certain
important sections of the penal code of a people whose
government was theocratic, whose only King was the
Most Holy and Righteous God. In view of the
manifold difficulties which are inseparable from the
enactment and enforcement of a just and equitable
penal code, it must be to every man who believes that
Israel, in that period of its history, was, in the most
literal sense, a theocracy, a matter of the highest civil
and governmental interest to observe what penalties
for crime were ordained by infinite wisdom, goodness,
and righteousness as the law of that nation.</p>

<p>This penal code (vv. 1-21) is given in two sections.
Of these, the first (vv. 1-6) relates to those who give
of their seed to Molech, or who are accessory to such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
crime by their concealment of the fact; and also to
those who consult wizards or familiar spirits. Under
this last head also comes ver. 27, which appears to
have become misplaced, as it follows the formal conclusion
of the chapter, and by its subject&mdash;the penalty for
the wizard, or him who claims to have a familiar spirit&mdash;evidently
belongs immediately after ver. 6.</p>

<p>The second section (vv. 9-21) enumerates, first
(vv. 9-16), other cases for which capital punishment
was ordered; and then (vv. 17-21) certain offences for
which a lesser penalty is prescribed. These two sections
are separated (vv. 7, 8) by a command, in view
of these penalties, to sanctification of life, and obedience
to the Lord, as the God who has redeemed and consecrated
Israel to be a nation to Himself.</p>

<p>These penal sections are followed (vv. 22-26) by
a general conclusion to the whole law of holiness, as
contained in these three chapters, as also to the law
concerning clean and unclean meats (xi.); which would
thus appear to have been originally connected more
closely than now with these chapters. This closing
part of the section consists of an exhortation and
argument against disobedience, in walking after the
wicked customs of the Canaanitish nations; enforced
by the declaration that their impending expulsion was
brought about by God in punishment for their practice
of these crimes; and, also, by the reminder that God
in His special grace had separated them to be a holy
nation to Himself, and that He was about to give them
the good land of Canaan as their possession.</p>

<p>It is perhaps hardly necessary to observe that the
law of this chapter does not profess to give the penal
code of Israel with completeness. Murder, for example,
is not mentioned here, though death is expressly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
denounced against it elsewhere (Numb. xxxv. 31). So,
again, in the Book of Exodus (xxi. 15) death is declared
as the penalty for smiting father or mother. Indeed,
the chapter itself contains evidence that it is essentially
a selection of certain parts of a more extended code,
which has been nowhere preserved in its entirety.</p>

<p>In this chapter death is ordained as the penalty for
the following crimes: viz., giving of one's seed to
Molech (vv. 2-5); professing to be a wizard, or to
have dealings with the spirits of the dead (ver. 27);
adultery, incest with a mother or step-mother, a
daughter-in-law or mother-in-law (vv. 10-12, 14);
and sodomy and bestiality (ver. 13). In a single case&mdash;that
of incest with a wife's mother&mdash;it is added
(ver. 14) that both the guilty parties shall be burnt
with fire; <em>i.e.</em>, after the usual infliction of death by
stoning. Of him who becomes accessory by concealment
to the crime of sacrifice to Molech, it is said
(ver. 5) that God Himself will set His face against
that man, and will cut off both the man himself and
his family. The same phraseology is used (ver. 6) of
those who consult familiar spirits; and the cutting off
is also threatened, ver. 18. The law concerning incest
with a full- or half-sister requires (ver. 17) that this
excision shall be "in the sight of the children of their
people;" <em>i.e.</em>, that the sentence shall be executed in
the most public way, thus to affix the more certainly
to the crime the stigma of an indelible ignominy and
disgrace. A lesser grade of penalty is attached to an
alliance with the wife of an uncle or of a brother; in the
latter case (ver. 21) that they shall be childless, in the
former (ver. 20), that they shall die childless; that is,
though they have children, they shall all be prematurely
cut off; none shall outlive their parents. To incest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
with an aunt by blood no specific penalty is affixed;
it is only said that "they shall bear their iniquity," <em>i.e.</em>,
God will hold them guilty.</p>

<p>The chapter, directly or indirectly, casts no little
light on some most fundamental and practical questions
regarding the administration of justice in dealing with
criminals.</p>

<p>We may learn here what, in the mind of the King
of kings, is the primary object of the punishment of
criminals against society. Certainly there is no hint
in this code of law that these penalties were specially
intended for the reformation of the offender. Were
this so, we should not find the death-penalty applied
with such unsparing severity. This does not indeed
mean that the reformation of the criminal was a matter
of no concern to the Lord; we know to the contrary.
But one cannot resist the conviction in reading this
chapter, as also other similar portions of the law, that
in a governmental point of view this was not the
chief object of punishment. Even where the penalty
was not death, the reformation of the guilty persons
is in no way brought before us as an object of the
penal sentence. In the governmental aspect of the
case, this is, at least, so far in the background that it
does not once come into view.</p>

<p>In our day, however, an increasing number maintain
that the death-penalty ought never to be inflicted,
because, in the nature of the case, it precludes the
possibility of the criminal being reclaimed and made
a useful member of society; and so, out of regard to
this and other like humanitarian considerations, in not
a few instances, the death penalty, even for wilful
murder, has been abrogated. It is thus, to a Christian
citizen, of very practical concern to observe that in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
theocratic penal code there is not so much as an allusion
to the reformation of the criminal, as one object which
by means of punishment it was intended to secure.
Penalty was to be inflicted, according to this code,
without any apparent reference to its bearing on this
matter. The wisdom of the Omniscient King of Israel,
therefore, must certainly have contemplated in the
punishment of crime some object or objects of more
weighty moment than this.</p>

<p>What those objects were, it does not seem hard to
discern. First and supreme in the intention of this
law is the satisfaction of outraged justice, and of the
regal majesty of the supreme and holy God, defied;
the vindication of the holiness of the Most High against
that wickedness of men which would set at nought
the Holy One and overturn that moral order which
He has established. Again and again the crime itself
is given as the reason for the penalty, inasmuch as by
such iniquity in the midst of Israel the holy sanctuary
of God among them was profaned. We read, for
example, "I will cut him off ... because he hath
defiled My sanctuary, and hath profaned My holy
name;" "they have wrought confusion," <em>i.e.</em>, in the
moral and physical order of the family; "their blood
shall be upon them;" "they have committed abomination;
they shall surely be put to death;" "it is a
shameful thing; they shall be cut off." Such are the
expressions which again and again ring through this
chapter; and they teach with unmistakable clearness
that the prime object of the Divine King of Israel in
the punishment was, not the reformation of the individual
sinner, but the satisfaction of justice and the vindication
of the majesty of broken law. And if we have no
more explicit statement of the matter here, we yet have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
it elsewhere; as in Numb. xxxv. 33, where we are
expressly told that the death-penalty to be visited with
unrelenting severity on the murderer is of the nature
of an expiation. Very clear and solemn are the words,
"Blood, it polluteth the land: and no expiation can
be made for the land for the blood that is shed therein,
but by the blood of him that shed it."</p>

<p>But if this is set forth as the fundamental reason for
the infliction of the punishment, it is not represented
as the only object. If, as regards the criminal himself,
the punishment is a satisfaction and expiation to justice
for his crime, on the other hand, as regards the people,
the punishment is intended for their moral good and
purification. This is expressly stated, as in ver. 14:
"They shall be burnt with fire, that there be no
wickedness among you." Both of these principles are
of such a nature that they must be of perpetual validity.
The government or legislative power that loses sight
of either of them is certain to go wrong, and the
people will be sure, sooner or later, to suffer in morals
by the error.</p>

<p>In the light we have now, it is easy to see what are
the principles according to which, in various cases, the
punishments were measured out. Evidently, in the
first place, the penalty was determined, even as equity
demands, by the intrinsic heinousness of the crime.
With the possible exception of a single case, it is easy
to see this. No one will question the horrible iniquity
of the sacrifice of innocent children to Molech; or of
incest with a mother, or of sodomy, or bestiality. A
second consideration which evidently had place, was
the danger involved in each crime to the moral and
spiritual well-being of the community; and, we may
add, in the third place, also the degree to which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
people were likely to be exposed to the contagion of
certain crimes prevalent in the nations immediately
about them.</p>

<p>But although these principles are manifestly so
equitable and benevolent as to be valid for all ages,
Christendom seems to be forgetting the fact. The
modern penal codes vary as widely from the Mosaic
in respect of their great leniency, as those of a few
centuries ago in respect of their undiscriminating
severity. In particular, the past few generations have
seen a great change with regard to the infliction of
capital punishment. Formerly, in England, for example,
death was inflicted, with intolerable injustice,
for a large number of comparatively trivial offences;
the death-penalty is now restricted to high treason and
killing with malice aforethought; while in some parts
of Christendom it is already wholly abolished. In the
Mosaic law, according to this chapter and other parts of
the law, it was much more extensively inflicted, though,
it may be noted in passing, always without torture. In
this chapter it is made the penalty for actual or constructive
idolatry, for sorcery, etc., for cursing father
or mother, for adultery, for the grosser degrees of
incest, and for sodomy and bestiality. To this list
of capital offences the law elsewhere adds, not only
murder, but blasphemy, sabbath-breaking, unchastity
in a betrothed woman when discovered after marriage,
rape, rebellion against a priest or judge, and man-stealing.</p>

<p>As regards the crimes specified in this particular
chapter, the criminal law of modern Christendom does
not inflict the penalty of death in a single possible
case here mentioned; and, to the mind of many, the
contrasted severity of the Mosaic code presents a grave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
difficulty. And yet, if one believes, on the authority of
the teaching of Christ, that the theocratic government
of Israel is not a fable, but a historic fact, although he
may still have much difficulty in recognising the righteousness
of this code, he will be slow on this account
either to renounce his faith in the Divine authority of
this chapter, or to impugn the justice of the holy King
of Israel in charging Him with undue severity; and
will rather patiently await some other solution of the
problem, than the denial of the essential equity of these
laws. But there are several considerations which, for
many, will greatly lessen, if they do not wholly remove,
the difficulty which the case presents.</p>

<p>In the first place, as regards the punishment of
idolatry with death, we have to remember that, from a
theocratic point of view, idolatry was essentially high
treason, the most formal repudiation possible of the
supreme authority of Israel's King. If, even in our
modern states, the gravity of the issues involved in
high treason has led men to believe that death is not
too severe a penalty for an offence aimed directly at
the subversion of governmental order, how much more
must this be admitted when the government is not of
fallible man, but of the most holy and infallible God?
And when, besides this, we recall the atrocious cruelties
and revolting impurities which were inseparably
associated with that idolatry, we shall have still less
difficulty in seeing that it was just that the worshipper
of Molech should die. And as decreeing the penalty of
death for sorcery and similar practices, it is probable
that the reason for this is to be found in the close connection
of these with the prevailing idolatry.</p>

<p>But it is in regard to crimes against the integrity
and purity of the family that we find the most impressive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
contrast between this penal code and those
of modern times. Although, unhappily, adultery and,
less commonly, incest, and even, rarely, the unnatural
crimes mentioned in this chapter, are not unknown in
modern Christendom, yet, while the law of Moses
punished all these with death, modern law treats them
with comparative leniency, or even refuses to regard
some forms of these offences as crimes. What then?
Shall we hasten to the conclusion that we have
advanced on Moses? that this law was certainly
unjust in its severity? or is it possible that modern law
is at fault, in that it has fallen below those standards of
righteousness which rule in the kingdom of God?</p>

<p>One would think that by any man who believes in
the Divine origin of the theocracy only one answer
could be given. Assuredly, one cannot suppose that
God judged of a crime with undue severity; and if
not, is not then Christendom, as it were, summoned by
this penal code of the theocracy&mdash;after making all due
allowance for different conditions of society&mdash;to revise
its estimate of the moral gravity of these and other
offences? In these days of continually progressive
relaxation of the laws regulating the relations of the
sexes, this seems indeed to be one of the chief lessons
from this chapter of Leviticus; namely, that in God's
sight sins against the seventh commandment are not
the comparative trifles which much over-charitable and
easy-going morality imagines, but crimes of the first
order of heinousness. We do well to heed this fact,
that not merely unnatural crimes, such as sodomy,
bestiality, and the grosser forms of incest, but adultery,
is by God ranked in the same category as murder. Is
it strange? For what are crimes of this kind but
assaults on the very being of the family? Where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
there is incest or adultery, we may truly say the
family is murdered; what murder is to the individual,
that, precisely, are crimes of this class to the family.
In the theocratic code these were, therefore, made
punishable with death; and, we venture to believe,
with abundant reason. Is it likely that God was too
severe? or must we not rather fear that man, ever
lenient to prevailing sins, in our day has become
falsely and unmercifully merciful, kind with a most
perilous and unholy kindness?</p>

<p>Still harder will it be for most of us to understand
why the death-penalty should have been also
affixed to cursing or smiting a father or a mother, an
extreme form of rebellion against parental authority.
We must, no doubt, bear in mind, as in all these cases,
that a rough people, like those just emancipated slaves,
required a severity of dealing which with finer natures
would not be needed; and, also, that the fact of
Israel's call to be a priestly nation bearing salvation
to mankind, made every disobedience among them the
graver crime, as tending to so disastrous issues, not
for Israel alone, but for the whole race of man which
Israel was appointed to bless. On an analogous principle
we justify military authority in shooting the
sentry found asleep at his post. Still, while allowing
for all this, one can hardly escape the inference that, in
the sight of God, rebellion against parents must be a
more serious offence than many in our time have been
wont to imagine. And the more that we consider how
truly basal to the order of government and of society
is both sexual purity and the maintenance of a spirit of
reverence and subordination to parents, the easier we
shall find it to recognise the fact that if in this penal
code there is doubtless great severity, it is yet the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
severity of governmental wisdom and true paternal
kindness on the part of the high King of Israel: who
governed that nation with intent, above all, that they
might become in the highest sense "a holy nation"
in the midst of an ungodly world, and so become the
vehicle of blessing to others. And God thus judged
that it was better that sinning individuals should die
without mercy, than that family government and family
purity should perish, and Israel, instead of being a
blessing to the nations, should sink with them into the
mire of universal moral corruption.</p>

<p>And it is well to observe that this law, if severe,
was most equitable and impartial in its application.
We have here, in no instance, torture; the scourging
which in one case is enjoined, is limited elsewhere
to the forty stripes save one. Neither have we discrimination
against any class, or either sex; nothing
like that detestable injustice of modern society which
turns the fallen woman into the street with pious scorn,
while it often receives the betrayer and even the
adulterer&mdash;in most cases the more guilty of the two&mdash;into
"the best society." Nothing have we here, again,
which could justify by example the insistence of many,
through a perverted humanity, when a murderess is
sentenced for her crime to the scaffold, her sex should
purchase a partial immunity from the penalty of crime.
The Levitical law is as impartial as its Author; even if
death be the penalty, the guilty one must die, whether
man or woman.</p>

<p>Quite apart, then, from any question of detail, as to
how far this penal code ought to be applied under the
different conditions of modern society, this chapter of
Leviticus assuredly stands as a most impressive testimony
from God against the humanitarianism of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
age. It is more and more the fashion, in some parts
of Christendom, to pet criminals; to lionize murderers
and adulterers, especially if in high social station.
We have even heard of bouquets and such-like sentimental
attentions bestowed by ladies on blood-red
criminals in their cells awaiting the halter; and a
maudlin pity quite too often usurps among us the place
of moral horror at crime and intense sympathy with
the holy justice and righteousness of God. But this
Divine government of old did not deal in flowers and
perfumes; it never indulged criminals, but punished
them with an inexorable righteousness. And yet
this was not because Israel's King was hard and cruel.
For it was this same law which with equal kindness
and equity kept a constant eye of fatherly care upon
the poor and the stranger, and commanded the Israelite
that he love even the stranger as himself. But,
none the less, the Lord God who declared Himself as
merciful and gracious and of great kindness, also
herein revealed Himself, according to His word, as one
who would "by no means clear the guilty." This fact
is luminously witnessed by this penal code; and, let
us note, it is witnessed by that penal law of God
which is revealed in nature also. For this too punishes
without mercy the drunkard, for example, or the licentious
man, and never diminishes one stroke because
by the full execution of penalty the sinner must suffer
often so terribly. Which is just what we should
expect to find, if indeed the God of nature is the One
who spake in Leviticus.</p>

<p>Finally, as already suggested, this chapter gives a
most weighty testimony against the modern tendency
to a relaxation of the laws which regulate the relations
of the sexes. That such a tendency is a fact is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
admitted by all; by some with gratulation, by others
with regret and grave concern. French law, for
instance, has explicitly legalised various alliances
which in this law God explicitly forbids, under heavy
penal sanctions, as incestuous; German legislation
has moved about as far in the same direction; and
the same tendency is to be observed, more or less, in
all the English-speaking world. In some of the United
States, especially, the utmost laxity has been reached, in
laws which, under the name of divorce, legalize gross
adultery,&mdash;laws which had been a disgrace to pagan
Rome. So it goes. Where God denounced the death-penalty,
man first apologises for the crime, then
lightens the penalty, then abolishes it, and at last
formally legalises the crime. This modern drift bodes
no good; in the end it can only bring disaster alike to
the well-being of the family and of the State. The
maintenance of the family in its integrity and purity
is nothing less than essential to the conservation of
society and the stability of good government.</p>

<p>To meet this growing evil, the Church needs to
come back to the full recognition of the principles which
underlie this Levitical code; especially of the fact that
marriage and the family are not merely civil arrangements,
but Divine institutions; so that God has not
left it to the caprice of a majority to settle what shall
be lawful in these matters. Where God has declared
certain alliances and connections to be criminal, we
shall permit or condone them at our peril. God rules,
whether modern majorities will it or not; and we
must adopt the moral standards of the kingdom of God
in our legislation, or we shall suffer. God has declared
that not merely the material well-being of man, but <em>holiness</em>,
is the moral end of government and of life; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
He will find ways to enforce His will in this respect.
"The nation that will not serve Him shall perish."
All this is not theology, merely, or ethics, but history.
All history witnesses that moral corruption and relaxed
legislation, especially in matters affecting the relations
of the sexes, bring in their train sure retribution, not
in Hades, but here on earth. Let us not miss of
taking the lesson by imagining that this law was for
Israel, but not for other peoples. The contrary is
affirmed in this very chapter (vv. 23, 24), where we
are reminded that God visited His heavy judgments
upon the Canaanitish nations precisely for this very
thing, their doing of these things which are in this law
of holiness forbidden. Hence "the land spued them
out." Our modern democracies, English, American,
French, German, or whatever they be, would do well
to pause in their progressive repudiation of the law of
God in many social questions, and heed this solemn
warning. For, despite the unbelief of multitudes, the
Holy One still governs the world, and it is certain
that He will never abdicate His throne of righteousness
to submit any of His laws to the sanction of a popular
vote.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</a></h2>

<h3><em>THE LAW OF PRIESTLY HOLINESS.</em></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lev.</span> xxi. 1-xxii. 33.</p>


<p>The conception of Israel as a kingdom of priests,
a holy nation, was concretely represented in a
threefold division of the people,&mdash;the congregation, the
priesthood, and the high priest. This corresponded
to the threefold division of the tabernacle into the
outer court, the holy place, and the holy of holies,
each in succession more sacred than the place preceding.
So while all Israel was called to be a priestly
nation, holy to Jehovah in life and service, this sanctity
was to be represented in degrees successively
higher in each of these three divisions of the people,
culminating in the person of the high priest, who, in
token of this fact, wore upon his forehead the inscription,
"<span class="smcap">Holiness to Jehovah</span>."</p>

<p>Up to this point the law of holiness has dealt only
with such obligations as bore upon all the priestly
nation alike; in these two chapters we now have the
special requirements of this law in its yet higher
demands upon, first, the priests, and, secondly, the
high priest.</p>

<p>Abolished as to the letter, this part of the law still
holds good as to the principle which it expresses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
namely, that special spiritual privilege and honour places
him to whom it is given under special obligations to
holiness of life. As contrasted with the world without,
it is not then enough that Christians should be equally
correct and moral in life with the best men of the
world; though too many seem to be living under
that impression. They must be more than this; they
must be holy: God will wink at things in others which
He will not deal lightly with in them. And so, again,
within the Church, those who occupy various positions
of dignity as teachers and rulers of God's flock are
just in that degree laid under the more stringent
obligation to holiness of life and walk. This most
momentous lesson confronts us at the very opening
of this new section of the law, addressed specifically
to "the priests, the sons of Aaron." How much it is
needed is sufficiently and most sadly evident from the
condition of baptized Christendom to-day. Who is
there that will heed it?</p>

<p>Priestly holiness was to be manifested, first (vv.
1-15), in regard to earthly relations of kindred and
friendship. This is illustrated under three particulars,
namely, in mourning for the dead (vv. 1-6), in
marriage (vv. 7, 8), and (ver. 9) in the maintenance
of purity in the priest's family. With regard to the
first point, it is ordered that there shall be no defilement
for the dead, except in the case of the priest's
own family,&mdash;father, mother, brother, unmarried sister,
son, or daughter.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> That is, with the exception of these
cases, the priest, though he may mourn in his heart,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
is to take no part in any of those last offices which
others render to the dead. This were "to profane
himself." And while the above exceptions are allowed
in the case of members of his immediate household,
even in these cases he is specially charged (ver. 5) to
remember, what was indeed elsewhere forbidden to
every Israelite, that such excessive demonstrations of
grief as shaving the head, cutting the flesh, etc., were
most unseemly in a priest. These restrictions are
expressly based upon the fact that he is "a chief man
among his people;" that he is holy unto God, appointed
to offer "the bread of God, the offerings made
by fire." And inasmuch as the high priest, in the
highest degree of all, represents the priestly idea, and
is thus admitted into a peculiar and exclusive intimacy
of relation with God, having on him "the crown of the
anointing oil of his God," and having been consecrated
to put on the "garments for glory and for beauty,"
worn by none other in Israel, with him the prohibition
of all public acts of mourning is made absolute (vv.
10-12). He may not defile himself, for instance, by
even entering the house where lies the dead body of
a father or a mother!</p>

<p>These regulations, at first thought, to many will
seem hard and unnatural. Yet this law of holiness
elsewhere magnifies and guards with most jealous care
the family relation, and commands that even the neighbour
we shall love as ourselves. Hence it is certain
that these regulations cannot have been intended to
condemn the natural feelings of grief at the loss of
friends, but only to place them under certain restrictions.
They were given, not to depreciate the earthly
relationships of friendship and kindred, but only to
magnify the more the dignity and significance of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
priestly relation to God, as far transcending even the
most sacred relations of earth. As priest, the son of
Aaron was the servant of the Eternal God, of God the
Holy and the Living One, appointed to mediate from
Him the grace of pardon and life to those condemned
to die. Hence he must never forget this himself, nor
allow others to forget it. Hence he must maintain a
special, visible separation from death, as everywhere
the sign of the presence and operation of sin and unholiness;
and while he is not forbidden to mourn,
he must mourn with a visible moderation; the more
so that if his priesthood had any significance, it meant
that death for the believing and obedient Israelite was
death in hope. And then, besides all this, God had
declared that He Himself would be the portion and
inheritance of the priests. For the priest therefore to
mourn, as if in losing even those nearest and dearest
on earth he had lost all, were in outward appearance
to fail in witness to the faithfulness of God to His
promises, and His all-sufficiency as his portion.</p>

<p>Standing here, will we but listen, we can now hear
the echo of this same law of priestly holiness from the
New Testament, in such words as these, addressed to
the whole priesthood of believers: "He that loveth
father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me;"
"Let those that have wives be as though they had
none, and those that weep as though they wept not;"
"Concerning them that fall asleep ... sorrow not,
even as the rest, which have no hope." As Christians,
we are not forbidden to mourn; but because a royal
priesthood to the God of life, who raised up the Lord
Jesus, and ourselves looking also for the resurrection,
ever with moderation and self-restraint. Extravagant
demonstrations of sorrow, whether in dress or in prolonged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
separation from the sanctuary and active service
of God, as the manner of many is, are all as contrary to
the New Testament law of holiness as to that of the
Old. When bereaved, we are to call to mind the
blessed fact of our priestly relation to God, and in this
we shall find a restraint and a remedy for excessive
and despairing grief. We are to remember that the
law for the High Priest is the law for all His priestly
house; like Him, they must all be perfected for the
priesthood by sufferings; so that, in that they themselves
suffer, being tried, they may be able the better
to succour others that are tried in like manner (2 Cor.
i. 4; Heb. ii. 18). We are also to remember that as
priests to God, this God of eternal life and love is
Himself our satisfying portion, and with holy care
take heed that by no immoderate display of grief we
even seem before men to traduce His faithfulness and
belie to unbelievers His glorious all-sufficiency.</p>

<p>The holiness of the priesthood was also to be represented
visibly in the marriage relation. A priest must
marry no woman to whose fair fame attaches the slightest
possibility of suspicion,&mdash;no harlot, or fallen woman,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
or a woman divorced (ver. 7); such an alliance were
manifestly most unseemly in one "holy to his God."
As in the former instance, the high priest is still further
restricted; he may not marry a widow, but only "a
virgin of his own people" (ver. 14); for virginity is
always in Holy Scripture the peculiar type of holiness.
As a reason it is added that this were to "profane his
seed among his people;" that is, it would be inevitable
that by neglect of this care the people would come to
regard his seed with a diminished reverence as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
separated priests of the holy God. From observing
the practice of many who profess to be Christians, one
would naturally infer that they can never have suspected
that there was anything in this part of the law which
concerns the New Testament priesthood of believers.
How often we see a young man or a young woman
professing to be a disciple of Christ, a member of Christ's
royal priesthood, entering into marriage alliance with
a confessed unbeliever in Him! And yet the law is laid
down as explicitly in the New Testament as in the Old
(1 Cor. vii. 39), that marriage shall be only "in the
Lord;" so that one principle rules in both dispensations.
The priestly line must, as far as possible, be
kept pure; the holy man must have a holy wife. Many,
indeed, feel this deeply and marry accordingly; but the
apparent thoughtlessness on the matter of many more
is truly astonishing, and almost incomprehensible.</p>

<p>And the household of the priest were to remember
the holy standing of their father. The sin of the child
of a priest was to be punished more severely than that
of the children of others; a single illustration is given
(ver. 9): "The daughter of any priest, if she profane
herself by playing the harlot, ... shall be burnt with
fire."<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> And the severity of the penalty is justified by
this, that by her sin "she profaneth her father." From
which it appears that, as a principle of the Divine
judgment, if the children of believers sin, their guilt
will be judged more heavy than that of others; and
that justly, because to their sin this is added, over like
sin of others, that they thereby cast dishonour on their
believing parents, and in them soil and defame the
honour of God. How little is this remembered by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
many in these days of increasing insubordination even
in Christian families!</p>

<p>The priestly holiness was to be manifested, in the
second place, in physical, bodily perfection. It is written
(ver. 17): "Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever he
be of thy seed throughout their generations that hath a
blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his
God."</p>

<p>And then follows (vv. 18-20) a list of various cases
in illustration of this law, with the proviso (vv. 21-23)
that while such a person might not perform any priestly
function, he should not be debarred from the use of the
priestly portion, whether of things "holy" or "most
holy," as his daily food. The material and bodily is
ever the type and symbol of the spiritual; hence, in
this case, the spiritual purity and perfection required of
him who would draw near to God in the priests' office
must be visibly signified by his physical perfection; else
the sanctity of the tabernacle were profaned. Moreover,
the reverence due from the people toward Jehovah's
sanctuary could not well be maintained where a dwarf,
for instance, or a humpback, were ministering at the
altar. And yet the Lord has for such a heart of kindness;
in kindly compassion He will not exclude them
from His table. Like Mephibosheth at the table of
David, the deformed priest may still eat at the table
of God.</p>

<p>There is a thought here which bears on the administration
of the affairs of God's house even now. We are
reminded that there are those who, while undoubtedly
members of the universal Christian priesthood, and
thus lawfully entitled to come to the table of the Lord,
may yet be properly regarded as disabled and debarred
by various circumstances, for which, in many cases,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
they may not be responsible, from any eminent position
in the Church.</p>

<p>In the almost unrestrained insistence of many in this
day for "equality," there are indications not a few of a
contempt for the holy offices ordained by Christ for His
Church, which would admit an equal right on the part
of almost any who may desire it, to be allowed to
minister in the Church in holy things. But as there
were dwarfed and blinded sons of Aaron, so are there
not a few Christians who&mdash;evidently, at least, to all but
themselves&mdash;are spiritually dwarfs or deformed; subject
to ineradicable and obtrusive constitutional infirmities,
such as utterly disqualify, and should preclude, them
from holding any office in the holy Church of Christ.
The presence of such in her ministry can only now, as
of old, profane the sanctuaries of the Lord.</p>

<p>The next section of the law of holiness for the
priests (xxii. 1-16) requires that the priests, as holy
unto Jehovah, treat with most careful reverence all those
holy things which are their lawful portion. If, in any
way, any priest have incurred ceremonial defilement,&mdash;as,
for instance, by an issue, or by the dead,&mdash;he is not
to eat until he is clean (vv. 2-7). On no account must
he defile himself by eating of that which is unclean,
such as that which has died of itself, or has been torn
by beasts (ver. 8), which indeed was forbidden even
to the ordinary Israelite. Furthermore, the priests are
charged that they preserve the sanctity of God's house
by carefully excluding all from participation in the
priests' portion who are not of the priestly order.
The stranger or sojourner in the priest's house, or a
hired servant, must not be fed from this "bread of
God;" not even a daughter, when, having married,
she has left the father's home to form a family of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
own, can be allowed to partake of it (ver. 12). If,
however (ver. 13), she be parted from her husband by
death or divorce, and have no child, and return to her
father's house, she then becomes again a member of
the priestly family, and resumes the privileges of her
virginity.</p>

<p>All this may seem, at first, remote from any present
use; and yet it takes little thought to see that, in
principle, the New Testament law of holiness requires,
under a changed form, even the same reverent use of
God's gifts, and especially of the Holy Supper of the
Lord, from every member of the Christian priesthood.
It is true that in some parts of the Church a superstitious
dread is felt with regard to approach to the Lord's
Table, as if only the conscious attainment of a very high
degree of holiness could warrant one in coming. But,
however such a feeling is to be deprecated, it is certain
that it is a less serious wrong, and argues not so ill
as to the spiritual condition of a man as the easy carelessness
with which multitudes partake of the Lord's
Supper, nothing disturbed, apparently, by the recollection
that they are living in the habitual practice of known
sin, unconfessed, unforsaken, and therefore unforgiven.
As it was forbidden to the priest to eat of those holy
things which were his rightful portion, with his defilement
or uncleanness on him, till he should first be
cleansed, no less is it now a violation of the law of
holiness for the Christian to come to the Holy Supper
having on his conscience unconfessed and unforgiven
sin. No less truly than the violation of this ancient
law is this a profanation, and who so desecrates the
holy food must bear his sin.</p>

<p>And as the sons of Aaron were charged by this law
of holiness that they guard the holy things from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
participation of any who were not of the priestly house,
so also is the obligation on every member of the New
Testament Church, and especially on those who are
in official charge of her holy sacraments, that they be
careful to debar from such participation the unholy
and profane. It is true that it is possible to go to an
extreme in this matter which is unwarranted by the
Word of God. Although participation in the Holy
Supper is of right only for the regenerate, it does not
follow, as in some sections of the Church has been
imagined, that the Church is therefore required to
satisfy herself as to the undoubted regeneration of
those who may apply for membership and fellowship
in this privilege. So to read the heart as to be able
to decide authoritatively on the regeneration of every
applicant for Church membership is beyond the power
of any but the Omniscient Lord, and is not required in
the Word. The Apostles received and baptized men
upon their credible profession of faith and repentance,
and entered into no inquisitorial cross-examination as
to the details of the religious experience of the candidate.
None the less, however, the law of holiness requires
that the Church, under this limitation, shall to the
uttermost of her power be careful that no one unconverted
and profane shall sit at the Holy Table of the
Lord. She may admit upon profession of faith and
repentance, but she certainly is bound to see to it that
such profession shall be credible; that is, such as may
be reasonably believed to be sincere and genuine. She
is bound, therefore, to satisfy herself in such cases, so
far as possible to man, that the life of the applicant,
at least externally, witnesses to the genuineness of the
profession. If we are to beware of imposing false tests
of Christian character, as some have done, for instance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
in the use or disuse of things indifferent, we are, on
the other hand, to see to it that we do apply such tests
as the Word warrants, and firmly exclude all such as
insist upon practices which are demonstrably, in themselves
always wrong, according to the law of God.</p>

<p>No man who has any just apprehension of Scriptural
truth can well doubt that we have here a lesson which
is of the highest present-day importance. When one
goes out into the world and observes the practices in
which many whom we meet at the Lord's Table habitually
indulge, whether in business or in society,&mdash;the
crookedness in commercial dealings and sharp dealing
in trade, the utter dissipation in amusement, of many
Church members,&mdash;a spiritual man cannot but ask,
Where is the discipline of the Lord's house? Surely,
this law of holiness applies to a multitude of such cases;
and it must be said that when such eat of the holy
things, they "profane them;" and those who, in
responsible charge of the Lord's Table, are careless
in this matter, "cause them to bear the iniquity that
bringeth guilt, when they eat their holy things" (ver.
16). That word of the Lord Jesus certainly applies in
this case (Matt. xviii. 7): "It must needs be that occasions
of stumbling come; but woe to that man through
whom the occasion cometh!"</p>

<p>The last section of the law concerning priestly holiness
(xxii. 17-33) requires the maintenance of jealous
care in the enforcement of the law of offerings. Inasmuch
as, in the nature of the case, while it rested with
the sons of Aaron to enforce this law, the obligation
concerned every offerer, this section (vv. 17-25) is
addressed also (ver. 18) "unto all the children of
Israel." The first requirement concerned the perfection
of the offering; it must be (vv. 19, 20) "without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
blemish." Only one qualification is allowed to this law,
namely, in the case of the free-will offering (ver. 23),
in which a victim was allowed which, otherwise perfect,
had something "superfluous or lacking in his parts."
Even this relaxation of the law was not allowed in the
case of an offering brought in payment of a vow; hence
Malachi (i. 14), in allusion to this law, sharply denounces
the man who "voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a
blemished thing." Verse 25 provides that this law
shall be enforced in the case of the foreigner, who may
wish to present an offering to Jehovah, no less than
with the Israelite.</p>

<p>A third requirement (ver. 27) sets a minimum limit
to the age of a sacrificial victim; it must not be less
than eight days old. The reason of this law, apart
from any mystic or symbolic meaning, is probably
grounded in considerations of humanity, requiring the
avoidance of giving unnecessary suffering to the dam.
A similar intention is probably to be recognised in the
additional law (ver. 28) that the cow, or ewe, and its
young should not both be killed in one day; though it
must be confessed that the matter is somewhat obscure.</p>

<p>Finally, the law closes (vv. 29, 30) with the repetition
of the command (vii. 15) requiring that the flesh of
the sacrifice of thanksgiving be eaten on the same day
in which it is offered. The slightest possibility of beginning
corruption is to be precluded in such cases with
peculiar strictness.</p>

<p>This closing section of the law of holiness, which
so insists that the regulations of God's law in regard
to sacrifice shall be scrupulously observed, in its
inner principle forbids all departures in matter of worship
from any express Divine appointment or command.
We fully recognise the fact that, as compared with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
old dispensation, the New Testament allows in the conduct
and order of worship a far larger liberty than then.
But, in our age, the tendency, alike in politics and in
religion, is to the confounding of liberty and license.
Yet they are not the same, but are most sharply
contrasted. Liberty is freedom of action within the
bounds of Divine law; license recognises no limitation
to human action, apart from enforced necessity,&mdash;no
law save man's own will and pleasure. It is therefore
essential lawlessness,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> and therefore is sin in its most
perfect and consummate expression. But there is law
in the New Testament as well as in the Old. Because
the New Testament lays down but few laws concerning
the order of Divine worship, it does not follow that
these few are of no consequence, and that men may
worship in all respects just as they choose, and equally
please God.</p>

<p>To illustrate this matter. It does not follow, because
the New Testament allows large liberty as regards the
details of worship, that therefore we may look upon
the use of images or pictures in connection with worship
as a matter of indifference. If told that these are
merely used as an aid to devotion,&mdash;the very argument
which in all ages has been used by all idolaters,&mdash;we
reply that, be that as it may, it is an aid which is
expressly prohibited under the heaviest penal sanctions
in both Testaments. We may take another present-day
illustration, which, especially in the American Church,
is of special pertinence. One would say that it should
be self-evident that no ordinance of the Church should
be more jealously guarded from human alteration or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
modification than the most sacred institution of the
sacramental Supper. Surely it should be allowed that
the Lord alone should have the right to designate the
symbols of His own death in this most holy ordinance.
That He chose and appointed for this purpose bread
and wine, even the fermented juice of the grape, has
been affirmed by the practically unanimous consensus
of Christendom for almost nineteen hundred years;
and it is not too much to say that this understanding
of the Scripture record is sustained by the no less
unanimous judgment of truly authoritative scholarship
even to-day. Neither can it be denied that Christ
ordained this use of wine in the Holy Supper with
the most perfect knowledge of the terrible evils connected
with its abuse in all ages. All this being so,
how can it but contravene this principle of the law of
holiness, which insists upon the exact observance of
the appointments which the Lord has made for His own
worship, when men, in the imagined interest of "moral
reform," presume to attempt improvements in this
holy ordinance of the Lord, and substitute for the wine
which He chose to make the symbol of His precious
blood, something else, of different properties, for the
use of which the whole New Testament affords no
warrant? We speak with full knowledge of the various
plausible arguments which are pressed as reasons why
the Church should authorise this nineteenth-century
innovation. No doubt, in many cases, the change is
urged through a misapprehension as to the historical
facts, which, however astonishing to scholars, is at
least real and sincere. But whenever any, admitting
the facts as to the original appointment, yet seriously
propose, as so often of late years, to improve on the
Lord's arrangements for His own Table, we are bold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
to insist that the principle which underlies this part
of the priestly law of holiness applies in full force in
this case, and cannot therefore be rightly set aside.
Strange, indeed, it is that men should unthinkingly
hope to advance morality by ignoring the primal principle
of all holiness, that Christ, the Son of God, is
absolute and supreme Lord over all His people, and
especially in all that pertains to the ordering of His
own house!</p>

<p>We have in these days great need to beseech the
Lord that He may deliver us, in all things, from that
malign epidemic of religious lawlessness which is one
of the plagues of our age; and raise up a generation
who shall so understand their priestly calling as Christians,
that, no less in all that pertains to the offices
of public worship, than in their lives as individuals
they shall take heed, above all things, to walk according
to the principles of this law of priestly holiness.
For, repealed although it be as to the outward form
of the letter, yet in the nature of the case, as to its
spirit and intention, it abides, and must abide, in force
unto the end. And the great argument also, with
which, after the constant manner of this law, this section
closes, is also, as to its spirit, valid still, and even of
greater force in its New Testament form than of old.
For we may now justly read it in this wise: "Ye
shall not profane My holy name, but I will be hallowed
among My people: I am the Lord that hallow you,
<em>that have redeemed you by the cross</em>, to be your God."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.</a></h2>

<h3><em>THE SET FEASTS OF THE LORD.</em></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lev.</span> xxiii. 1-44.</p>


<p>It is even an instinct of natural religion to observe
certain set times for special public and united
worship. As we should therefore anticipate, such
observances are in this chapter enjoined as a part of
the requirement of the law of holiness for Israel.</p>

<p>It is of consequence to observe that the Revisers have
corrected the error of the Authorised Version, which
renders two perfectly distinct words alike as "feasts;"
and have distinguished the one by the translation, "set
feasts," the other by the one word, "feasts." The
precise sense of the former word is given in the margin
"appointed seasons," and it is naturally applied to all
the set times of special religious solemnity which are
ordained in this chapter. But the other word translated
"feast,"&mdash;derived from a root meaning "to dance,"
whence "feast" or "festival,"&mdash;is applied to only
three of the former six "appointed seasons," namely,
the feasts of Unleavened Bread, of Pentecost, and of
Tabernacles; as intended to be, in a special degree,
seasons of gladness and festivity.</p>

<p>The indication of this distinction is of importance,
as completely meeting the allegation that there is in
this chapter evidence of a later development than in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
account of the feasts given in Exod. xxxiv., where the
number of the "feasts," besides the weekly Sabbath,
is given as three, while here, as it is asserted, their
number has been increased to six. In reality, however,
there is nothing here which suggests a later
period. For the object of the former law in Exodus
was only to name the "feasts" (<em>haggím</em>); while that
of the chapter before us is to indicate not only these,&mdash;which
here, as there, are three,&mdash;but, in addition to
these, all "appointed seasons" for "holy convocations,"
which, although all <i>mo'adim</i>, were not all <i>haggím</i>.</p>

<p>The observance of public religious festivals has been
common to all the chief religions of the world, both
ancient and modern. Very often, though not in all
cases, these have been determined by the phases of
the moon; or by the apparent motion of the sun in
the heavens, as in many instances of religious celebrations
connected with the period of the spring and
autumnal equinoxes; and thus, very naturally, also
with the times of harvest and ingathering. It is at
once evident that of these appointed seasons of holy
convocation, the three feasts (<i>haggím</i>) of the Hebrews
also fell at certain points in the harvest season; and
with each of these, ceremonies were observed connected
with harvest and ingathering; while two, the feast of
weeks and that of tabernacles, take alternate names,
directly referring to this their connection with the
harvest; namely, the feast of firstfruits and that of
ingathering. Thus we have, first, the feast of unleavened
bread, following passover, which was distinguished by
the presentation of a sheaf of the firstfruits of the
barley harvest, in the latter part of March, or early in
April; then, the feast of weeks, or firstfruits, seven
weeks later, marking the completion of the grain harvest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
with the ingathering of the wheat; and, finally, the
feast of tabernacles or ingathering, in the seventh month,
marking the harvesting of the fruits, especially the oil
and the wine, and therewith the completed ingathering
of the whole product of the year.</p>

<p>From these facts it is argued that in these Hebrew
feasts we have simply a natural development, with
modifications, of the ancient and widespread system
of harvest feasts among the heathen; to which the
historical element which appears in some of them was
only added as an afterthought, in a later period of
history. From this point of view, the idea that these
feasts were a matter of supernatural revelation disappears;
what religious character they have belongs
originally to the universal religion of nature.</p>

<p>But it is to be remarked, first, that even if we admit
that in their original character these were simply and
only harvest feasts, it would not follow that therefore
their observance, with certain prescribed ceremonies,
could not have been matter of Divine revelation.
There is a religion of nature; God has not left Himself
without a witness, in that He has given men "rains
and fruitful seasons," filling their hearts with food and
gladness. And, as already remarked in regard to
sacrifice, it is no part of the method of God in revelation
to ignore or reject what in this religion of nature may
be true and right; but rather to use it, and build on
this foundation.</p>

<p>But, again, the mere fact that the feast of unleavened
bread fell at the beginning of barley harvest, and that
one&mdash;though only one&mdash;ceremony appointed for that
festive week had explicit reference to the then beginning
harvest, is not sufficient to disprove the uniform
declaration of Scripture that, as observed in Israel, its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
original ground was not natural, but historical; namely,
in the circumstances attending the birth of the nation
in their exodus from Egypt.</p>

<p>But we may say more than this. If the contrary
were true, and the introduction of the historical element
was an afterthought, as insisted by some, then we
should expect to find that in accounts belonging to
successive periods, the reference to the harvest would
certainly be more prominent in the earlier, and the
reference of the feast to a historical origin more prominent
in the later, accounts of the feasts. Most singular
it is then, upon this hypothesis, to find that even
accepting the analysis, <em>e.g.</em>, of Wellhausen, the facts
are the exact reverse. For the only brief reference to
the harvest in connection with this feast of unleavened
bread is found in this chap. xxiii. of Leviticus, composed,
it is alleged, about the time of Ezekiel; while,
on the other hand, the narrative in Exod. xii., regarded
by all the critics of this school as the earliest account
of the origin of the feast of unleavened bread, refers
only to the historical event of the exodus, as the occasion
of its institution. If we grant the asserted difference
in age of these two parts of the Pentateuch, one would
thus more naturally conclude that the historical events
were the original occasion of the institution of the
festival, and that the reference to the harvest, in the
presentation of the sheaf of firstfruits, was the later
introduction into the ceremonies of the week.</p>

<p>But the truth is that this naturalistic identification of
these Hebrew feasts with the harvest feasts of other
nations is a mistake. In order to make it out, it is
necessary to ignore or pervert most patent facts.
These so-called harvest feasts in fact form part of an
elaborate system of sacred times,&mdash;a system which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
based upon the Sabbath, and into which the sacred
number seven, the number of the covenant, enters
throughout as a formative element. The weekly
Sabbath, first of all, was the seventh day; the length
of the great festivals of unleavened bread and of tabernacles
was also, in each case, seven days. Not only
so, but the entire series of sacred times mentioned in
this chapter and in chap. xxv. constitutes an ascending
series of sacred septenaries, in which the ruling
thought is this: that the seventh is holy unto the Lord,
as the number symbolic of rest and redemption; and
that the eighth, as the first of a new week, is symbolic
of the new creation. Thus we have the seventh day,
the weekly Sabbath, constantly recurring, the type of
each of the series; then, counting from the feast of
unleavened bread,&mdash;the first of the sacred year,&mdash;the
fiftieth day, at the end of the seventh week, is signalised
as sacred by the feast of firstfruits or of
"weeks;" the seventh month, again, is the sabbatic
month, of special sanctity, containing as it does three of
the annual seasons of holy convocation,&mdash;the feast of
trumpets on its first day, the great day of atonement
on the tenth, and the last of the three great annual
feasts, that of tabernacles or ingathering, for seven
days from the fifteenth day of the month. Beyond this
series of sacred festivals recurring annually, in chap.
xxv., the seventh year is appointed to be a sabbatic
year of rest to the land, and the series at last culminates
at the expiration of seven sevens of years, in the
fiftieth year,&mdash;the eighth following the seventh seven,&mdash;the
great year of jubilee, the supreme year of rest,
restoration, and release. All these sacred times,
differing in the details of their observance, are alike
distinguished by their connection with the sacred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
number seven, by the informing presence of the idea
of the Sabbath, and therewith always a new and
fuller revelation of God as in covenant with Israel for
their redemption.</p>

<p>Now, like to this series of sacred times, in heathenism
there is absolutely nothing. It evidently belongs to
another realm of thought, ethics, and religion. And
so, while it is quite true that in the three great feasts
there was a reference to the harvest, and so to fruitful
nature, yet the fundamental, unifying idea of the
system of sacred times was not the recognition of the
fruitful life of nature, as in the heathen festivals, but of
Jehovah, as the Author and Sustainer of the life of His
covenant people Israel, as also of every individual in
the nation. This, we repeat, is the one central thought
in all these sacred seasons; not the life of nature, but
the life of the holy nation, as created and sustained by
a covenant God. The annual processes of nature have
indeed a place and a necessary recognition in the
system, simply because the personal God is active in
all nature; but the place of these is not primary, but
secondary and subordinate. They have a recognition
because, in the first place, it is through the bounty of
God in nature that the life of man is sustained; and,
secondly, also because nature in her order is a type
and shadow of things spiritual. For in the spiritual
world, whether we think of it as made up of nations
or individuals, even as in the natural, there is a seed-time
and a harvest, a time of firstfruits and a time
of the joy and rest of the full ingathering of fruit, and
oil, and wine. Hence it was most fitting that this
inspired rubric, as primarily intended for the celebration
of spiritual things, should be so arranged and
timed, in all its parts, as that in each returning sacred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
season, visible nature should present itself to Israel as
a manifest parable and eloquent suggestion of those
spiritual verities; the more so that thus the Israelite
would be reminded that the God of the Exodus and the
God of Sinai was also the supreme Lord of nature, the
God of the seed-time and harvest, the Creator and
Sustainer of the heavens and the earth, and of all that
in them is.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Weekly Sabbath.</span></p>

<p class="center">xxiii. 1-3.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children
of Israel, and say unto them, The set feasts of the Lord, which ye
shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are My set feasts.
Six days shall work be done: but on the seventh day is a sabbath of
solemn rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of work: it
is a sabbath unto the Lord in all your dwellings."</p></blockquote>

<p>The first verse of this chapter announces the purpose
of the section as, not to give a complete calendar
of sacred times or of seasons of worship,&mdash;for the new
moons and the sabbatic year and the jubilee are not
mentioned,&mdash;but to enumerate such sacred times as are
to be kept as "holy convocations." The reference in
this phrase cannot be to an assembling of the people
at the central sanctuary, which is elsewhere ordered
(Exod. xxxiv. 23) only for the three feasts of passover,
weeks, and atonement; but rather, doubtless, to local
gatherings for purposes of worship, such as, at a later
day, took form in the institution of the synagogues.</p>

<p>The enumeration of these "set times" begins with
the Sabbath (ver. 3), as was natural; for, as we have
seen, the whole series of sacred times was sabbatic in
character. The sanctity of the day is emphasised in
the strongest terms, as a <i>shabbath shabbathon</i>, a "sabbath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
of sabbatism,"&mdash;a "sabbath of solemn rest," as it is
rendered by the Revisers. While on some other
sacred seasons the usual occupations of the household
were permitted, on the Sabbath "no manner of work"
was to be done; not even was it lawful to gather wood
or to light a fire.</p>

<p>For this sanctity of the Sabbath two reasons are
elsewhere given. The first of these, which is assigned
in the fourth commandment, makes it a memorial of
the rest of God, when having created man in Eden, He
saw His work which He had finished, that it was very
good, and rested from all His work. As created, man
was participant in this rest of God. He was indeed to
work in tilling the garden in which he had been placed;
but from such labour as involves unremunerative toil
and exhaustion he was exempt. But this sabbatic rest
of the creation was interrupted by sin; God's work,
which He had declared "good," was marred; man fell
into a condition of wearying toil and unrest of body
and soul, and with him the whole creation also was
"subjected to vanity" (Gen. iii. 17, 18; Rom. viii. 20).
But in this state of things the God of love could not
rest; it thus involved for Him a work of new creation,
which should have for its object the complete restoration,
both as regards man and nature, of that sabbatic
state of things on earth which had been broken up by
sin. And thus it came to pass that the weekly Sabbath
looked not only backward, but forward; and spoke not
only of the rest that was, but of the great sabbatism of
the future, to be brought in through a promised redemption.
Hence, as a second reason for the observance
of the Sabbath, it is said (Exod. xxxi. 13) to be a sign
between God and Israel through all their generations,
that they might know that He was Jehovah which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
sanctified them, <em>i.e.</em>, who had set them apart for deliverance
from the curse, that through them the world might
be saved.</p>

<p>These are thus the two sabbatic ideas; rest and
redemption. They everywhere appear, in one form
or another, in all this sabbatic series of sacred times.
Some of them emphasise one phase of the rest and
redemption, and some another; the weekly Sabbath,
as the unit of the series, presents both. For in
Deuteronomy (v. 15) Israel was commanded to keep
the Sabbath in commemoration of the exodus, as the
time when God undertook to bring them into His rest;
a rest of which the beginning and the pledge was their
deliverance from Egyptian bondage; a rest brought in
through a redemption.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Feast of Passover and Unleavened Bread.</span></p>

<p class="center">xxiii. 4-14.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"These are the set feasts of the Lord, even holy convocations,
which ye shall proclaim in their appointed season. In the first month,
on the fourteenth day of the month at even, is the Lord's passover.
And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened
bread unto the Lord: seven days ye shall eat unleavened bread. In
the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile
work. But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord
seven days: in the seventh day is an holy convocation; ye shall do
no servile work. And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak
unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into
the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof,
then ye shall bring the sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto
the priest: and he shall wave the sheaf before the Lord, to be accepted
for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.
And in the day when ye wave the sheaf, ye shall offer a he-lamb
without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the Lord.
And the meal offering thereof shall be two tenth parts of an ephah of
fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the Lord for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
a sweet savour: and the drink offering thereof shall be of wine, the
fourth part of an hin. And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched
corn, nor fresh ears, until this selfsame day, until ye have brought the
oblation of your God: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations
in all your dwellings."</p></blockquote>

<p>Verses 5-8 give the law for the first of the annual
feasts, the passover and unleavened bread. The passover
lamb was to be slain and eaten on the evening
of the fourteenth day; and thereafter, for seven days,
they were all to eat unleavened bread. The first and
seventh days of unleavened bread were to be kept as
an "holy convocation;" in both of which "servile
work," <em>i.e.</em>, the usual occupations in the field or in
one's handicraft, were forbidden. Further than this
the restriction did not extend.</p>

<p>The utter impossibility of making this feast of passover
also to have been at first merely a harvest festival
is best shown by the signal failure of the many attempts
to explain on this theory the name "passover" as
applied to the sacrificial victim, and the exclusion of
leaven for the whole period. Admit the statements of
the Pentateuch on this subject, and all is simple. The
feast was a most suitable commemoration by Israel
of the solemn circumstances under which they began
their national life: their exemption from the plague
of the death of the first-born, through the blood of a
slain victim; and their exodus thereafter in such haste
that they stopped not to leaven their bread.</p>

<p>And there was a deeper spiritual meaning than this.
Whereas, secured by the sprinkling of blood, they then
fed in safety on the flesh of the victim, by which they
received strength for their flight from Egypt, the same
two thoughts were thereby naturally suggested which
we have seen represented in the peace-offering; namely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
friendship and fellowship with God secured through
sacrifice, and life sustained by His bounty. And the unleavened
bread, also, had more than a historic reference;
else it had sufficed to eat it only on the anniversary
night, and it had not been commanded also to put
away the leaven from their houses. For leaven is the
established symbol of moral corruption; and in that,
the passover lamb having been slain, Israel must
abstain for a full septenary period of a week from
every use of leaven, it was signified in symbol that
the redeemed nation must not live by means of what
is evil, but be a holy people, according to their calling.
And the inseparable connection of this with full consecration
of person and service, and with the expiation
of sin, was daily symbolised (ver. 8) by the "offerings
made by fire," burnt-offerings, meal-offerings, and sin-offerings,
"offerings made by fire unto the Lord."</p>

<p>On "the morrow after the Sabbath" (ver. 15) of
this sacred week, it was ordered (ver. 10) that "the
sheaf of the firstfruits of the (barley) harvest" should
be brought "unto the priest;" and (ver. 11) that he
should consecrate it unto the Lord, by the ceremony
of waving it before Him. This wave-offering of the
sheaf of firstfruits was to be accompanied (vv. 12, 13)
by a burnt-offering, a meal-offering, and a drink-offering
of wine. Until all this was done (ver. 14)
they were to "eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor
fresh ears" of the new harvest. By the consecration
of the firstfruit is ever signified the consecration of the
whole, of which it is the first part, unto the Lord. By
this act, Israel, at the very beginning of their harvest,
solemnly consecrated the whole harvest to the Lord;
and are only permitted to use it, when they receive it
thus as a gift from Him. This ethical reference to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
harvest is here expressly taught; but still more was
thereby taught in symbol.</p>

<p>For Israel was declared (Exod. iv. 22) to be God's
first-born; that is, in the great redemptive plan of God,
which looks forward to the final salvation of all nations,
Israel ever comes historically first. "The Jew first,
and also the Greek," is the New Testament formula
of this fundamental dispensational truth. The offering
unto God, therefore, of the sheaf of firstfruits, at the
very beginning of the harvest,&mdash;in fullest harmony
with the historic reference of this feast, which commemorated
Israel's deliverance from bondage and
separation from the nations, as a firstfruits of redemption,&mdash;symbolically
signified the consecration of Israel
unto God as the first-born unto Him from the nations,
the beginning of the world's great harvest.</p>

<p>But this is not all. For in these various ceremonies
of this first of the feasts, all who acknowledge the
authority of the New Testament will recognise a
yet more profound, and prophetic, spiritual meaning.
Passover and unleavened bread not only looked backward,
but forward. For the Apostle Paul writes, addressing
all believers (1 Cor. v. 7, 8): "Purge out the
old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, even as ye are
unleavened. For our passover also hath been sacrificed,
even Christ: wherefore let us keep the feast, not with
old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and
wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity
and truth;"&mdash;an exposition so plain that comment is
scarcely needed. And as following upon the passover,
on the morrow after the Sabbath, the first day of the
week, the sheaf of firstfruits was presented before
Jehovah, so in type is brought before us that of which
the same Apostle tells us (1 Cor. xv. 20), that Christ,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
in that He rose from the dead on the first day after
the Sabbath, became "the firstfruits of them that are
asleep;" thus, for the first time, finally and exhaustively
fulfilling this type, in full accord also with His own
representation of Himself (John xii. 24) as "a grain
of wheat," which should "fall into the earth and die,"
and then, living again, "bear much fruit."</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Feast of Pentecost.</span></p>

<p class="center">xxiii. 15-21.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath,
from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven
sabbaths shall there be complete: even unto the morrow after the
seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new
meal offering unto the Lord. Ye shall bring out of your habitations
two wave loaves of two tenth parts of an ephah: they shall be of fine
flour, they shall be baken with leaven, for firstfruits unto the Lord.
And ye shall present with the bread seven lambs without blemish of
the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be
a burnt offering unto the Lord, with their meal offering, and their
drink offerings, even an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto
the Lord. And ye shall offer one he-goat for a sin offering, and two
he-lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings. And the
priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits for a wave
offering before the Lord, with the two lambs: they shall be holy
to the Lord for the priest. And ye shall make proclamation on the
selfsame day; there shall be an holy convocation unto you: ye shall
do no servile work: it is a statute for ever in all your dwellings
throughout your generations."</p></blockquote>

<p>Next in order came the feast of firstfruits, or the
feast of weeks, which, because celebrated on the
fiftieth day after the presentation of the wave-sheaf
in passover week, has come to be known as Pentecost,
from the Greek numeral signifying fifty. It
was ordered that the fiftieth day after this presentation
of the first sheaf of the harvest should be
kept as a day of "holy convocation," with abstinence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
from all "servile work." The former festival had
marked the absolute beginning of the harvest with the
first sheaf of barley; this marked the completion of
the grain harvest with the reaping of the wheat. In
the former, the sheaf was presented as it came from
the field; in this case, the offering was of the grain as
prepared for food. It was ordered (ver. 16) that on
this day "a new meal offering" should be offered.
It should be brought out of their habitations and be
baken with leaven. In both particulars, it was unlike
the ordinary meal-offerings, because the offering was
to represent the ordinary food of the people. Accompanied
with a sevenfold burnt-offering, and a sin-offering,
and two lambs of peace-offerings, these were to
be waved before the Lord for their acceptance, after the
manner of the wave-sheaf (vv. 18-20). On the altar they
could not come, because they were baken with leaven.</p>

<p>This festival, as one of the sabbatic series, celebrated
the rest after the labours of the grain harvest, a symbol
of the great sabbatism to follow that harvest which is
"the end of the age" (Matt. xiii. 39). As a consecration,
it dedicated unto God the daily food of the nation
for the coming year. As passover reminded them that
God was the Creator of Israel, so herein, receiving
their daily bread from Him, they were reminded that
He was also the Sustainer of Israel; while the full
accompaniment of burnt-offerings and peace-offerings
expressed their full consecration and happy state of
friendship with Jehovah, secured through the expiation
of the sin-offering.</p>

<p>Was this feast also, like passover, prophetic? The
New Testament is scarcely less clear than in the former
case. For after that Christ, first having been slain as
"our Passover," had then risen from the dead as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
"Firstfruits," fulfilling the type of the wave-sheaf on
the morning of the Sabbath, fifty days passed; "and
when the day of Pentecost was fully come," came that
great outpouring of the Holy Ghost, the conversion of
three thousand out of many lands (Acts ii.), and therewith
the formation of that Church of the New Testament
whose members the Apostle James declares
(i. 18) to be "a kind of firstfruits of God's creatures."
Thus, as the sheaf had typified Christ as "the Firstborn
from the dead," the presentation on the day of
Pentecost of the two wave-loaves, the product of the
sheaf of grain, no less evidently typified the presentation
unto God of the Church of the first-born, the first-fruits
of Christ's death and resurrection, as constituted
on that sacred day. This then was the complete fulfilment
of the feast of weeks regarded as a redemptive
type, showing how, not only rest, but also redemption
was comprehended in the significance of the sabbatic
idea. And yet, that complete redemption was not
therewith attained by that Church of the first-born on
Pentecost was presignified in that the two wave-loaves
were to be baken with leaven. The feast of unleavened
bread had exhibited the ideal of the Christian life;
that of firstfruits, the imperfection of the earthly
attainment. On earth the leaven of sin still abides.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Feast of Trumpets.</span></p>

<p class="center">xxiii. 23-25.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children
of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first day of the month,
shall be a solemn rest unto you, a memorial of blowing of trumpets,
an holy convocation. Ye shall do no servile work: and ye shall
offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord."</p></blockquote>

<p>By a very natural association of thought, in ver. 22
the direction to leave the gleaning of the harvest for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
the poor and the stranger is repeated verbally from
chap. xix. 9, 10. Thereupon we pass from the feast
of the seventh week to the solemnities of the seventh
month, in which the series of annual sabbatic seasons
ended. It was thus, by eminence, the sabbatic season
of the year. Of the "set times" of this chapter, three
fell in this month, and of these, two&mdash;the day of atonement
and tabernacles&mdash;were of supreme significance:
the former being distinguished by the most august
religious solemnity of the year, the entrance of the
high priest into the Holy of Holies to make atonement
for the sins of the nation; the latter marking the completion
of the ingathering of the products of the year,
with the fruit, the oil, and the wine. Of this sabbatic
month, it is directed (vv. 23-25) that the first day be
kept as a <i>shabbathon</i>, "a solemn rest," marked by
abstinence from all the ordinary business of life, and
a holy convocation. The special ceremony of the day,
which gave it its name, is described as a "memorial
of blowing of trumpets." This "blowing of trumpets"
was a reminder, not from Israel to God, as some have
fancied, but from God to Israel. It was an announcement
from the King of Israel to His people that the
glad sabbatic month had begun, and that the great day
of atonement, and the supreme festivity of the feast of
tabernacles, was now at hand.</p>

<p>That the first day of this sabbatic month should be
thus sanctified was but according to the Mosaic principle
that the consecration of anything signifies the consecration
unto God of the whole. "If the firstfruit is
holy, so also the lump;" in like manner, if the first day,
so is the month. Trumpets&mdash;though not the same
probably as used on this occasion&mdash;were also blown on
other occasions, and, in particular, at the time of each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
new moon; but, according to tradition, these only by
the priests and at the central sanctuary; while in this
feast of trumpets every one blew who would, and
throughout the whole land.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Day of Atonement.</span></p>

<p class="center">xxiii. 26-32.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Howbeit on the tenth
day of this seventh month is the day of atonement: it shall be an
holy convocation unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls; and ye
shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord. And ye shall do
no manner of work in that same day: for it is a day of atonement, to
make atonement for you before the Lord your God. For whatsoever
soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut
off from his people. And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any
manner of work in that same day, that soul will I destroy from
among his people. Ye shall do no manner of work: it is a statute
for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings. It shall
be unto you a sabbath of solemn rest, and ye shall afflict your souls:
in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye
keep your sabbath."</p></blockquote>

<p>After this festival of annunciation, followed, on the
tenth day of the month, the great annual day of atonement.
This has already come before us (chap. xiii.) in
its relation to the sacrificial system, of which the sin-offering
of this day was the culmination. But this
chapter brings it before us in another aspect, namely,
in its relation to the annual septenary series of sacred
seasons, the final festival of which it preceded and
introduced.</p>

<p>Its significance, as thus coming in this final seventh
and sabbatic month of the ecclesiastical year, lay not
merely in the strictness of the rest which was commanded
(vv. 28-30) from every manner of work, but,
still more, in that it expressed in a far higher degree
than any other festival the other sabbatic idea of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
complete restoration brought in through expiation for
sin. This was indeed the central thought of the whole
ceremonial of the day,&mdash;the complete removal of all
those sins of the nation which stood between them
and God, and hindered complete restoration to God's
favour. And while this restoration was symbolised
by the sacrifice of the sin-offering, and its presentation
and acceptance before Jehovah in the Holy of Holies;
yet, that none might hence argue from the fact of
atonement to license to sin, it was ordained (ver. 27)
that the people should "afflict their souls," namely, by
fasting,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> in token of their penitence for the sins for
which atonement was made; and the absolute necessity
of this condition of repentance in order to any benefit
from the high-priestly sacrifice and intercession was
further emphasised by the solemn threat (ver. 29):
"Whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in
that same day, he shall be cut off from his people."</p>

<p>These then were the lessons&mdash;lessons of transcendent
moment for all people and all ages&mdash;which were
set forth in the great atonement of the sabbatic month,&mdash;the
complete removal of sin by an expiatory offering,
conditioned on the part of the worshipper by the
obedience of faith and sincere repentance for the sin,
and issuing in rest and full establishment in God's
loving favour.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Feast of Tabernacles.</span></p>

<p class="center">xxiii. 33-43.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children
of Israel, saying, On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the Lord. On the first day
shall be an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work. Seven
days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord: on the
eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall offer
an offering made by fire unto the Lord: it is a solemn assembly; ye
shall do no servile work. These are the set feasts of the Lord,
which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering
made by fire unto the Lord, a burnt offering, and a meal offering, a
sacrifice, and drink offerings, each on its own day: beside the
sabbaths of the Lord, and beside your gifts, and beside all your
vows, and beside all your freewill offerings, which ye give unto the
Lord. Howbeit on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye
have gathered in the fruits of the land, ye shall keep the feast of the
Lord seven days: on the first day shall be a solemn rest, and on
the eighth day shall be a solemn rest. And ye shall take you on the
first day the fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and boughs
of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before
the Lord your God seven days. And ye shall keep it a feast unto
the Lord seven days in the year: it is a statute for ever in your
generations: ye shall keep it in the seventh month. Ye shall dwell
in booths seven days; all that are homeborn in Israel shall dwell in
booths: that your generations may know that I made the children of
Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of
Egypt: I am the Lord your God."</p></blockquote>

<p>The sin of Israel having been thus removed, the last
and the greatest of all the feasts followed&mdash;the feast of
tabernacles or ingathering. It occupied a full week
(ver. 34), from the fifteenth to the twenty-second of the
month, the first day being signalised by a holy convocation
and abstinence from all servile work (ver. 35).
Two reasons are indicated, here and elsewhere, for the
observance: the one, natural (ver. 39), the completed
ingathering of the products of the year; the other,
historical (vv. 42, 43),&mdash;it was to be a memorial of the
days when Israel dwelt in booths in the wilderness.
Both ideas were represented in the direction (ver. 40)
that they should take on the first day "the fruit of
goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and boughs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
thick trees, and willows of the brook," fitly symbolising
the product of the vine and the fruit-trees which were
harvested in this month; and, making booths of these, all
were to dwell in these tabernacles, and "rejoice before
the Lord their God seven days." And to this the historical
reason is added, "that your generations may
know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in
booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt."</p>

<p>No one need feel any difficulty in seeing in this a
connection with similar harvest and vintage customs
among other peoples of that time. That other nations
had festivities of this kind at that time, was surely no
reason why God should not order these to be taken
up into the Mosaic law, elevated in their significance,
and sanctified to higher ends. Nothing could be more
fitting than that the completion of the ingathering of
the products of the year should be celebrated as a
time of rejoicing and a thanksgiving day before
Jehovah. Indeed, so natural is such a festivity to
religious minds, that&mdash;as is well known&mdash;in the first
instance, New England, and then, afterward, the whole
United States, and also the Dominion of Canada, have
established the observance of an annual "Thanksgiving
Day" in the latter part of the autumn, which is
observed by public religious services, by suspension
of public business, and as a glad day of reunion of
kindred and friends. It is interesting to observe how
this last feature of the day is also mentioned in the
case of this Hebrew feast, in the later form of the law
(Deut. xvi. 13-15): "After that thou hast gathered in
from thy threshing-floor and from thy winepress ...
thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and
thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant,
and the Levite, and the stranger, and the fatherless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
and the widow, that are within thy gates, ... and thou
shalt be altogether joyful."</p>

<p>The chief sentiment of the feast was thus joy and
thanksgiving to God as the Giver of all good. Yet the
joy was not to be merely natural and earthly, but
spiritual; they were to rejoice (ver. 40) "before the
Lord." And the thanksgiving was not to be expressed
merely in words, but in deeds. The week, we are
elsewhere told, was signalised by the largest burnt-offerings
of any of the feasts, consisting of a total of
seventy bullocks, beginning with thirteen on the first
day, and diminishing by one each day; while these
again were accompanied daily by burnt-offerings of
fourteen lambs and two rams, the double of what was
enjoined even for the week of unleavened bread, with
meal-offerings and drink-offerings in proportion. Nor
was this outward ritual expression of thanksgiving
enough; for their gratitude was to be further attested
by taking into their glad festivities the Levite who
had no portion, the fatherless and the widow, and even
the stranger.</p>

<p>It is not hard to see the connection of all this with
the historical reference to the days of their wilderness
journeyings. Lest they might forget God in nature,
they were to recall to mind, by their dwelling in
booths, the days when they had no houses, and no
fields nor crops, when, notwithstanding, none the less
easily the Almighty God of Israel fed them with manna
which they knew not, that He might make them to
"know that man doth not live by bread only, but by
every thing that proceedeth out of the mouth of the
Lord" (Deut. viii. 3). There is, indeed, no better illustration
of the intention of this part of the feast than those
words with their context as they occur in Deuteronomy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span></p>

<p>The ceremonies of the feast of tabernacles having
been completed with the appointed seven days, there
followed an eighth day,&mdash;an holy convocation, a festival
of solemn rest (vv. 36, 39). This last day of holy
solemnity and joy, to which a special name is given, is
properly to be regarded, not as a part of the feast of
tabernacles merely, but as celebrating the termination
of the whole series of sabbatic times from the first to
the seventh month. No ceremonial is here enjoined
except the holy convocation, and the offering of "an
offering made by fire unto the Lord," with abstinence
from all servile work.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Typical Meaning of the Feasts of the
Seventh Month.</span></p>

<p>We have already seen that the earlier feasts of
the year were also prophetic; that Passover and
Unleavened Bread pointed forward to Christ, our
Passover, slain for us; Pentecost, to the spiritual
ingathering of the firstfruits of the world's harvest,
fifty days after the presentation of our Lord in resurrection,
as the wave-sheaf of the firstfruits. We may
therefore safely infer that these remaining feasts of the
seventh month must be typical also. But, if so, typical
of what? Two things may be safely said in this
matter. The significance of the three festivals of this
seventh month must be interpreted in harmony with
what has already passed into fulfilment; and, in the
second place, inasmuch as the feast of trumpets, the
day of atonement, and the feast of tabernacles all
belong to the seventh and last month of the ecclesiastical
year, they must find their fulfilment in connection
with what Scripture calls "the last times."</p>

<p>Keeping the first point in view, we may then safely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
say that if Pentecost typified the firstfruits of the
world's harvest in the ingathering of an election from
all nations, the feast of tabernacles must then typify
the completion of that harvest in a spiritual ingathering,
final and universal. Not only so, but, inasmuch as
in the antitypical fulfilment of the wave-sheaf in the
resurrection of our Lord, we were reminded that the
consummation of the new creation is in resurrection
from the dead, and that in regeneration is therefore
involved resurrection, hence the feast of tabernacles, as
celebrating the absolute completion of the year's harvest,
must typify also the resurrection season, when all
that are Christ's shall rise from the dead at His coming.
And, finally, whereas this means for the now burdened
earth permanent deliverance from the curse, and the
beginning of a new age thus signalised by glorious
life in resurrection, in which are enjoyed the blessed
fruits of life's labours and pains for Christ, this was
shadowed forth by the ordinance that immediately
upon the seven days of tabernacles should follow a
feast of the eighth day, the first day of a new week, in
celebration of the beginning season of rest from all the
labours of the field.</p>

<p>Most beautifully, thus regarded, does all else connected
with the feast of tabernacles correspond, as type
to antitype, to the revelation of the last things, and
therein reveal its truest and deepest spiritual significance:
the joy, the reunion, the rejoicing with son and
with daughter, the fulness of gladness also for the
widow and the fatherless; and this, not only for those
in Israel, but also for the stranger, not of Israel,&mdash;for
Gentile as well as Israelite was to have part in the
festivity of that day; and, again, the full attainment of
the most complete consecration, signified in the ten-fold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
burnt-offering;&mdash;all finds its place here. And so
now we can see why it was that our Saviour declared
(Matt. xiii. 39) that the end of this present age should
be the time of harvest; and how Paul, looking at the
future spiritual ingathering, places the ingathering of
the Gentiles (Rom. xi. 25) as one of the last things.
In full accord with this interpretation of the typical
significance of this feast it is that in Zech. xiv. we
find it written that in the predicted day of the Lord,
when (ver. 5) the Lord "shall come, and all the holy
ones" with Him, and (ver. 9) "the Lord shall be
King over all the earth; ... the Lord ... one, and
His name one," then (ver. 16) "every one that is left
of all the nations ... shall go up from year to year
to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, and to keep the
feast of tabernacles;" and, moreover, that so completely
shall consecration be realised in that day that (ver. 20)
even upon the bells of the horses shall the words be
inscribed, "<span class="smcap">Holy unto the Lord</span>!"</p>

<p>But before the joyful feast of tabernacles could be
celebrated, the great, sorrowful day of atonement must
be kept,&mdash;a season marked, on the one hand, by affliction
of soul throughout all Israel; on the other, by the
complete putting away of the sin of the nation for the
whole year, through the presentation of the blood of
the sin-offering by the high priest, within the veil
before the mercy seat. Now, if the feast of tabernacles
has been correctly interpreted, as presignifying in
symbol the completion of the great world harvest in
the end of the age, does the prophetic word reveal anything
in connection with the last things as preceding
that great harvest, and, in some sense, preparing for
and ushering in that day, which should be the antitype
of the great day of atonement?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span></p>

<p>One can hardly miss of the answer. For precisely
that which the prophets and apostles both represent
as the event which shall usher in that great day of
final ingathering and of blessed resurrection rest and
joy in consummated redemption, is the national repentance
of Israel, and the final cleansing of their age-long
sin. In the type, two things are conspicuous: the
great sorrowing of the nation and the great atonement
putting away all Israel's sin. And two things, in like
manner, are conspicuous in the prophetic pictures of
the antitype, namely, Israel's heart-broken repentance,
and the removal thereupon of Israel's sin; their cleansing
in the "fountain opened for sin and for uncleanness."
As Zechariah puts it (xii. 10, xiii. 1), "I will pour
upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplication; and
they shall look unto me whom they have pierced: and
they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his
only son;" and "in that day there shall be a fountain
opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants
of Jerusalem, for sin and for uncleanness." And the
relation of this cleansing of Israel to the days of
blessing which follow is most explicitly set forth by the
Apostle Paul, in these words concerning Israel (Rom.
xi. 12, 15), "If their fall is the riches of the world,
and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much
more their fulness? If the casting away of them is
the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving
of them be, but life from the dead?"</p>

<p>So far, then, all seems clear. But the feast of
trumpets yet remains to be explained. Has Holy
Scripture predicted anything, falling in the period
between Pentecost and the repentance of Israel, but
specially belonging to the last things, which might with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
reason be regarded as the antitype of this joyful feast
of trumpets? Here, again, it is not easy to go far
astray. For the essential idea of the trumpet call is
announcement, proclamation. From time to time all
through the year the trumpet-call was heard in Israel;
but on this occasion it became the feature of the day,
and was universal throughout their land. And, as
we have seen, its special significance for that time
was to announce that the day of atonement and the
feast of ingathering, which typified the full consummation
of the kingdom of God, were now at hand.
One can thus hardly fail to think at once of that other
event which, according to our Lord's express word
(Matt. xxiv. 14), is immediately to precede "the end,"
namely, the universal proclamation of the Gospel:
"This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the
whole world for a testimony unto all the nations; and
then shall the end come." As throughout the year,
from time to time, the trumpet call was heard in Israel,
but only in connection with the central sanctuary; but
now in all the land, as the chief thing in the celebration
of the day which ushered in the final sabbatic month,
precisely so in the antitype. All through the ages has
the Gospel been sounded forth, but in a partial and
limited way; but at "the time of the end" the proclamation
shall become universal. And thus and then
shall the feast of trumpets also, like Passover and
Pentecost, pass into complete fulfilment, and be swiftly
followed by Israel's repentance and restoration, and
the consequent reappearing, as Peter predicts (Acts
iii. 19-21 R.V.), of Israel's High Priest from within the
veil, and thereupon the harvest of the world, the resurrection
of the just, and the consummation upon earth of
the glorified kingdom of God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span></p>

<p>Of many thoughts of a practical kind which this
chapter suggests, we may perhaps well dwell especially
on one. The ideal of religious life, which these set
times of the Lord kept before Israel, was a religion of
joy. Again and again is this spoken of in the accounts
of these feasts. This is true even of Passover, with
which we oftener, though mistakenly, connect thoughts
of sadness and gloom. Yet Passover was a feast of
joy; it celebrated the birthday of the nation, and a
deliverance unparalleled in history. The only exception
to this joyful character in all these sacred times is
found in the day of atonement; but it is itself instructive
on the same point, teaching most clearly that in
the Divine order, as in the necessity of the case, the joy
in the Lord, of which the feast of ingathering was the
supreme expression, must be preceded by and grounded
in an accepted expiation and true penitence for sin.</p>

<p>So it is still with the religion of the Bible: it is a
religion of joy. God does not wish us to be gloomy
and sad. He desires that we should ever be joyful
before Him, and thus find by blessed experience that
"the joy of the Lord is our strength." Also, in particular,
we do well to observe further that, inasmuch
as all these set times were sabbatic seasons, joyfulness
is inseparably connected with the Biblical conception
of the Sabbath. This has been too often forgotten;
and the weekly day of sabbatic rest has sometimes
been made a day of stern repression and forbidding
gloom. How utterly astray are such conceptions from
the Divine ideal, we shall perhaps the more clearly
see when we call to mind the thought which appears
more or less distinctly in all these sabbatic seasons,
that every Sabbath points forward to the eternal joy
of the consummated kingdom, the sabbath rest which
remaineth for the people of God (Heb. iv. 9).</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.</a></h2>

<h3><em>THE HOLY LIGHT AND THE SHEW-BREAD:
THE BLASPHEMER'S END.</em></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lev.</span> xxiv. 1-23.</p>


<p>It is not easy to determine with confidence the
association of thought which occasioned the interposition
of this chapter, with its somewhat disconnected
contents, between chap. xxiii., on the set times of holy
convocation, and chap. xxv., on the sabbatic and
jubilee years, which latter would seem most naturally
to have followed the former immediately, as relating
to the same subject of sacred times. Perhaps the best
explanation of the connection with the previous chapter
is that which finds it in the reference to the olive oil
for the lamps and the meal for the shew-bread. The
feast of tabernacles, directions for which had just been
given, celebrated the completed ingathering of the
harvest of the year, both of grain and of fruit; and
here Israel is told what is to be done with a certain
portion of each.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Ordering of the Light in the Holy Place.</span></p>

<p class="center">xxiv. 1-4.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Command the children
of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure olive oil beaten for the light,
to cause a lamp to burn continually. Without the veil of the testimony,
in the tent of meeting, shall Aaron order it from evening to morning
before the Lord continually: it shall be a statute for ever throughout
your generations. He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick
before the Lord continually."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span></p>

<p>First (vv. 1-4) is given the direction for the ordering
of the daily light, which was to burn from evening until
morning in the holy place continually. The people
themselves are to furnish the oil for the seven-branched
candlestick out of the product of their olive yards.
The oil is to be "pure," carefully cleansed from leaves
and all impurities; and "beaten," that is, not extracted
by heat and pressure, as are inferior grades, but simply
by beating and macerating the olives with water,&mdash;a
process which gives the very best. The point in these
specifications is evidently this, that for this, as always,
they are to give to God's service the very best,&mdash;an
eternal principle which rules in all acceptable service
to God. The oil is to come from the people in general,
so that the illuminating of the Holy Place, although
specially tended by the high priest, is yet constituted
a service in which all the children of Israel have some
part. The oil was to be used to supply the seven
lamps upon the golden candlestick which was placed
on the south side of the Holy Place, without the veil
of the testimony, in the tent of meeting. This Aaron
was to "order from evening to morning before the
Lord continually." According to Exod. xxv. 31-40, this
candlestick&mdash;or, more properly, lampstand&mdash;was made
of a single shaft, with three branches on either side,
each with a cup at the end like an almond blossom;
so that, with that on the top of the central shaft, it
was a stand of seven lamps, in a conventional imitation
of an almond tree.</p>

<p>The significance of the symbol is brought clearly
before us in Zech. iv. 1-14, where the seven-branched
candlestick symbolises Israel as the congregation of God,
the giver of the light of life to the world. And yet a
lamp can burn only as it is supplied with oil and trimmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
and cared for. And so in the symbol of Zechariah
the prophet sees the golden candlestick supplied with
oil conveyed through two golden pipes into which
flowed the golden oil, mysteriously self-distilled from
two olive trees on either side the candlestick. And
the explanation given is this: "Not by might, nor by
power, but by My Spirit," saith the Lord. Thus we
learn that the golden seven-branched lampstand denotes
Israel, more precious than gold in God's sight, appointed
of Him to be the giver of light to the world. And
yet by this requisition of oil for the golden candlestick
the nation was reminded that their power to give light
was dependent upon the supply of the heavenly grace
of God's Spirit, and the continual ministrations of the
priest in the Holy Place. And how this ordering of
the light might be a symbolic act of worship, we can
at once see, when we recall the word of Jesus (Matt.
v. 14, 16): "Ye are the light of the world.... Let
your light shine before men, that they may see your
good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven."</p>

<p>How pertinent for instruction still in all its deepest
teaching is this ordinance of the lamp continually burning
in the presence of the Lord, is vividly brought
before us in the Apocalypse (i. 12, 13), where we
read that seven candlesticks appeared in vision to the
Apostle John; and Christ, in His glory, robed in high-priestly
vesture, was seen walking up and down, after
the manner of Aaron, in the midst of the seven candlesticks,
in care and watch of the manner of their burning.
And as to the significance of this vision, the Apostle
was expressly told (ver. 20) that the seven candlesticks
were the seven Churches of Asia,&mdash;types of the collective
Church in all the centuries. Thus, as in the language of
this Levitical symbol, we are taught that in the highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
sense it is the office of the Church to give light in
darkness; but that she can only do this as the heavenly
oil is supplied, and each lamp is cared for, by the high-priestly
ministrations of her risen Lord.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The "Bread of the Presence."</span></p>

<p class="center">xxiv. 5-9.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And thou shall take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof:
two tenth parts of an ephah shall be in one cake. And thou shalt
set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure table before the
Lord. And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it
may be to the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire
unto the Lord. Every sabbath day he shall set it in order before the
Lord continually; it is on the behalf of the children of Israel, an everlasting
covenant. And it shall be for Aaron and his sons; and they
shall eat it in a holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the offerings
of the Lord made by fire by a perpetual statute."</p></blockquote>

<p>Next follows the ordinance for the preparation and
presentation of the "shew-bread," <em>lit.</em>, "bread of the
Face," or "Presence," <em>sc.</em> of God. This was to consist
of twelve cakes, each to be made of two tenth parts
of an ephah of fine flour, which was to be placed in
two rows or piles, "upon the pure table" of gold that
stood before the Lord, in the Holy Place, opposite to
the golden candlestick. On each pile was to be placed
(ver. 7) "pure frankincense,"&mdash;doubtless, as tradition
says, placed in the golden spoons, or little cups (Exod.
xxxvii. 16). Every sabbath (vv. 8, 9) fresh bread was
to be so placed, when the old became the food of Aaron
and his sons only, as belonging to the order of things
"most holy;" the frankincense which had been its
"memorial" having been first burned, "an offering
made by fire unto the Lord" (ver. 7). Tradition adds
that the bread was always unleavened; a few have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
called this in question, but this has been only on theoretic
grounds, and without evidence; and when we
remember how stringent was the prohibition of leaven
even in any offerings made by fire upon the altar of the
outer court, much less is it likely that it could have
been tolerated here in the Holy Place immediately before
the veil.</p>

<p>This bread of the Presence must be regarded as in
its essential nature a perpetual meal-offering,&mdash;the
meal-offering of the Holy Place, as the others were of
the outer court.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> The material was the same, cakes
of fine flour; to this frankincense must be added as a
"memorial," as in the meal-offerings of the outer court.
Such part of the offering as was not burned, as in the
case of the others, was to be eaten by the priests only,
as a thing "most holy." It differed from those in that
there were always the twelve cakes, one for each tribe;
and in that while they were repeatedly offered, this
lay before the Lord continually. The altar of burnt-offering
might sometimes be empty of the meal-offering,
but the table of shew-bread, "the table of the Presence,"
never.</p>

<p>In general, therefore, the meaning of the offering of
the shew-bread must be the same as that of the meal-offerings;
like them it symbolised the consecration
unto the Lord of the product of the labour of the hands,
and especially of the daily food as prepared for use.
But in this, by the twelve cakes for the twelve tribes
it was emphasised that God requires, not only such
consecration of service and acknowledgment of Him
from individuals, as in the law of chap. ii., but from
the nation in its collective and organised capacity; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
that not merely on such occasions as pious impulse
might direct, but continuously.</p>

<p>In these days, when the tendency among us is to an
extreme individualism, and therewith to an ignoring or
denial of any claim of God upon nations and communities
as such, it is of great need to insist upon this
thought thus symbolised. It was not enough in God's
sight that individual Israelites should now and then
offer their meal-offerings; the Lord required a meal-offering
"on behalf of the children of Israel" <em>as a
whole</em>, and of each particular tribe of the twelve, each
in its corporate capacity. There is no reason to think
that in the Divine government the principle which took
this symbolical expression is obsolete. It is not enough
that individuals among us consecrate the fruit of their
labours to the Lord. The Lord requires such consecration
of every nation collectively; and of each of
the subdivisions in that nation, such as cities, towns,
states, provinces, and so on. Yet where in the wide
world can we see one such consecrated nation? Can
we find one such consecrated province or state, or even
such a city or town? Where then, from this biblical
and spiritual point of view, is the ground for the religious
boasting of the Christian progress of our day
which one sometimes hears? Must we not say, "It is
excluded"?</p>

<p>Typically, the shew-bread, like the other meal-offerings
with their frankincense, must foreshadow the
work of the Messiah in holy consecration; and, in
particular, as the One in whom the ideal of Israel
was perfectly realised, and who thus represented in His
person the whole Israel of God. But the bread of the
Presence represents His holy obedience in self-consecration,
not merely, as in the other meal-offerings, presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
in the outer court, in the sight of men, as in His
earthly life; but here, rather, as continually presented
before the "Face of God," in the Holy Place, where
Christ appears in the presence of God for us. And
in this symbolism, which has been already justified,
we may recognise the element of truth that there is in
the view held by Bähr,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> apparently, as by others, that
the shew-bread typified Christ Himself regarded as
the bread of life to His people. Not indeed, precisely,
that Christ Himself is brought before us here, but
rather His holy obedience, continually offered unto
God in the heavenly places, in behalf of the true Israel,
and as sealing and confirming the everlasting covenant;&mdash;this
is what this symbol brings before us. And it
is as we by faith appropriate Him, as thus ever presenting
His holy life to God for us, that He becomes
for us the Bread of Life.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Penalty of Blasphemy.</span></p>

<p class="center">xxiv. 10-23.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an
Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel: and the son of the
Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp;
and the son of the Israelitish woman blasphemed the Name, and
cursed: and they brought him unto Moses. And his mother's name
was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan. And they
put him in ward, that it might be declared unto them at the mouth
of the Lord. And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Bring forth
him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard him
lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him.
And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever
curseth his God shall bear his sin. And he that blasphemeth the
name of the Lord, he shall surely be put to death; all the congregation
shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as the homeborn,
when he blasphemeth the name of the Lord, shall be put to
death. And he that smiteth any man mortally shall surely be put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
to death; and he that smiteth a beast mortally shall make it good:
life for life. And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he
hath done, so shall it be done to him; breach for breach, eye for eye,
tooth for tooth: as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be
rendered unto him. And he that killeth a beast shall make it good:
and he that killeth a man shall be put to death. Ye shall have one
manner of law, as well for the stranger, as for the homeborn: for I
am the Lord your God. And Moses spake to the children of Israel,
and they brought forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and
stoned him with stones. And the children of Israel did as the Lord
commanded Moses."</p></blockquote>

<p>The connection of this section with the preceding
context is now impossible to determine. Very possibly
its insertion here may be due to the occurrence here
described having taken place at the time of the delivery
of the preceding laws concerning the oil for the golden
lampstand and the shew-bread. However, the purport
and intention of the narrative is very plain,
namely, to record the law delivered by the Lord for
the punishment of blasphemy; and therewith also His
command that the penalty of broken law, both in this
case and in others specified, should be exacted both
from native Israelites and from foreigners alike.</p>

<p>The incident which was the occasion of the promulgation
of these laws was as follows. The son of an
Israelitish woman by an Egyptian husband fell into a
quarrel in the camp. As often happens in such cases,
the one sin led on to another and yet graver sin; the
half-caste man "blasphemed the Name, and cursed;"
whereupon he was arrested and put into confinement
until the will of the Lord might be ascertained in his
case. "The Name" is of course the name of God;
the meaning is that he used the holy name profanely
in cursing. The passage, together with ver. 16, is of
special and curious as upon these two the Jews
have based their well-known belief that it is unlawful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
to utter the Name which we commonly vocalise as
Jehovah; whence it has followed that wherever in the
Hebrew text the Name occurs it is written with the
vowels of <em>Adonáy</em>, "Lord," to indicate to the reader
that this word was to be substituted for the proper
name,&mdash;a usage which is represented in the Septuagint
by the appearance of the Greek word <i lang="gr" xml:lang="gr">Kurios</i>, "Lord," in
all places where the Hebrew has Jehovah (or Yáhveh);
and which, in both the authorised and revised versions,
is still maintained in the retention of "Lord"
in all such cases,&mdash;a relic of Jewish superstition which
one could greatly wish that the Revisers had banished
from the English version, especially as in many passages
it totally obscures to the English reader the
exact sense of the text, wherever it turns upon the
choice of this name. It is indeed true that the word
rendered "blaspheme" has the meaning "to pronounce,"
as the Targumists and other Hebrew writers
render it; but that it also means simply to "revile,"
and in many places cannot possibly be rendered "to
pronounce," is perforce admitted even by Jewish
scholars.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> To give it the other meaning here were so
plainly foreign to the spirit of the Old Testament,
debasing reverence to superstition, that no argument
against it will be required with any but a Jew.</p>

<p>And this young man, in the heat of his passion,
"reviled the Name." The words "of the Lord" are not
in the Hebrew; the name "Jehovah" is thus brought
before us expressively as <span class="smcap">The Name</span>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i>,
of God, as revealing Himself in covenant for man's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
redemption.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Horrified at the man's wickedness, "they
brought him unto Moses;" and "they put him in
ward" (ver. 12), "that it might be declared unto them
at the mouth of the Lord" what should be done unto
him. This was necessary because the case involved
two points upon which no revelation had been made:
first, as to what should be the punishment of blasphemy;
and secondly, whether the law in such cases
applied to a foreigner as well as to the native
Israelite. The answer of God decided these points. As
to the first (ver. 15), "Whosoever curseth his God shall
bear his sin," <em>i.e.</em>, he shall be held subject to punishment;
and (ver. 16), "He that blasphemeth the name of
the Lord, he shall surely be put to death; all the congregation
shall certainly stone him." And as to the second
point, it is added, "as well the stranger, as the homeborn,
when he blasphemeth the Name, shall be put to death."</p>

<p>Then follows (vv. 17-21) a declaration of penalties
for murder, for killing a neighbour's beast, and for
inflicting a bodily injury on one's neighbour. These
were to be settled on the principle of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lex talionis</i>,
life for life, "breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for
tooth;" in the case of the beast killed, its value was
to be made good to the owner. All these laws had
been previously given (Exod. xxi. 12, 23-36); but are
repeated here plainly for the purpose of expressly
ordering that these laws, like that now declared for
blasphemy, were to be applied alike to the home-born
and the stranger (ver. 22).</p>

<p>Much cavil have these laws occasioned, the more so
that Christ Himself is cited as having condemned them
in the Sermon on the Mount (Matt. v. 38-42). But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
how little difficulty really exists here will appear from
the following considerations. The Jews from of old
have maintained that the law of "an eye for eye," as
here given, was not intended to authorise private and
irresponsible retaliation in kind, but only after due trial
and by legal process. Moreover, even in such cases,
they have justly remarked that the law here given
was not meant to be applied always with the most
exact literality; but that it was evidently intended to
permit the commutation of the penalty by such a fine
as the judges might determine. They justly argue
from the explicit prohibition of the acceptance of any
such satisfaction in commutation in the case of a
murderer (Numb. xxxv. 31, 32) that this implies the
permission of it in the instances here mentioned;&mdash;a
conclusion the more necessary when it is observed
that the literal application of the law in all cases would
often result in defeating the very ends of exact justice
which it was evidently intended to secure. For instance,
the loss by a one-eyed man of his only eye, under such
an interpretation, would be much more than an equivalent
for the loss of an eye which he had inflicted upon
a neighbour who had both eyes. Hence, Jewish history
contains no record of the literal application of the law
in such cases; the principle is applied as often among
ourselves, in the exaction from an offender of a
pecuniary satisfaction proportioned to the degree of
the disability he has inflicted upon his neighbour.
Finally, as regards the words of our Saviour, that He
did not intend His words to be taken in their utmost
stretch of literality in all cases, is plain from His own
conduct when smitten by the order of the high priest
(John xviii. 23), and from the statement that the magistrate
is endowed with the sword, as a servant of God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
to be a terror to evil-doers (Rom. xiii. 4); from
which it is plain that Christ did not mean to prohibit
the resort to judicial process under all circumstances,
but rather the spirit of retaliation and litigation which
sought to justify itself by a perverse appeal to this law
of "an eye for eye;"&mdash;a law which, in point of fact,
was given, as Augustine has truly observed, not "as
an incitement to, but for the mitigation of wrath."</p>

<p>The narrative then ends with the statement (ver. 23)
that Moses delivered this law to the children of Israel,
who then, according to the commandment of the Lord,
took the blasphemer out of the camp, when all that
heard him blaspheme laid their hands upon his head,
in token that they thus devolved on him the responsibility
for his own death; and then the congregation
stoned the criminal with stones that he died (ver. 23).</p>

<p>The chief lesson to be learned from this incident and
from the law here given is very plain. It is the high
criminality in God's sight of all irreverent use of His
holy name. To a great extent in earlier days this
was recognised by Christian governments; and in the
Middle Ages the penalty of blasphemy in many states
of Christendom, as in the Mosaic code and in many
others, although not death, was yet exceedingly severe.
The present century, however, has seen a great relaxation
of law, and still more of public sentiment, in regard
to this crime,&mdash;a change which, from a Christian point
of view, is a matter for anything but gratulation.
Reverence for God lies at the very foundation of even
common morality. Our modern atheism and agnosticism
may indeed deny this, and yet, from the days of
the French Revolution to the present, modern history
has been presenting, in one land and another, illustrations
of the fact which are pregnant with most solemn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
warning. And while no one could wish that the crime
of blasphemy should be punished with torture and
cruelty, as in some instances in the Middle Ages, yet
the more deeply one thinks on this subject in the light
of the Scripture and of history, the more, if we mistake
not, will it appear that it might be far better for us,
and might argue a far more hopeful and wholesome
condition of the public sentiment than that which now
exists, if still, as in Mosaic days and sometimes in the
Middle Ages, death were made the punishment for this
crime;&mdash;a crime which not only argues the extreme of
depravity in the criminal, but which, if overlooked by
the State, or expiated with any light penalty, cannot
but operate most fatally by breaking down in the public
conscience that profound reverence toward God which
is the most essential condition of the maintenance of
all private and public morality.</p>

<p>In this point of view, not to speak of other considerations,
it is not surprising that the theocratic law here
provides that blasphemy shall be punished with death
in the case of the foreigner as well as the native
Israelite. This sin, like those of murder and violence
with which it is here conjoined, is of such a kind that
to every conscience which is not hopelessly hardened,
its wickedness must be manifest even from the very
light of nature. Nature itself is sufficient to teach any
one that abuse and calumny of the Supreme God, the
Maker and Ruler of the world,&mdash;a Being who, if He exist
at all, must be infinitely good,&mdash;must be a sin involving
quite peculiar and exceptional guilt. Hence, absolute
equity, no less than governmental wisdom, demanded
that the law regarding blasphemy, as that with respect
to the other crimes here mentioned, should be impartially
enforced upon both the native Israelite and the foreigner.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</a></h2>

<h3><em>THE SABBATIC YEAR AND THE JUBILEE.</em></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lev.</span> xxv. 1-55.</p>


<p>The system of annually recurring sabbatic times,
as given in chap. xxiii., culminated in the sabbatic
seventh month. But this remarkable system of
sabbatisms extended still further, and, besides the sacred
seventh day, the seventh week, and seventh month,
included also a sabbatic seventh year; and beyond
that, as the ultimate expression of the sabbatic idea,
following the seventh seven of years, came the
hallowed fiftieth year, known as the jubilee. And
the law concerning these two last-named periods is
recorded in this twenty-fifth chapter of Leviticus.</p>

<p>First (vv. 1-5), is given the ordinance of the sabbatic
seventh year, in the following words: "When ye come
into the land which I give you, then shall the land
keep a sabbath unto the Lord. Six years thou shalt
sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard,
and gather in the fruits thereof; but in the
seventh year shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the
land, a sabbath unto the Lord: thou shalt neither sow
thy field, nor prune thy vineyard. That which groweth
of itself of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, and the
grapes of thy undressed vine thou shalt not gather: it
shall be a year of solemn rest for the land."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span></p>

<p>This sacred year is thus here described as a sabbath
for the land unto the Lord,&mdash;a <i>shabbath shabbathon</i>;
that is, a sabbath in a special and eminent sense. No
public religious gatherings were ordered, however,
neither was labour of every kind prohibited. It was
strictly a year of rest for the land, and for the people
in so far as this was involved in that fact. There was
to be no sowing or reaping, even of what might grow
of itself; no pruning of vineyard or fruit trees, nor
gathering of their fruit. These regulations thus involved
the total suspension of agricultural labour for
this entire period.</p>

<p>It was further ordered (vv. 6, 7) that during this
year the spontaneous produce of the land should be
equally free to all, both man and beast: "The sabbath
of the land shall be for food for you; for thee, and
for thy servant and for thy maid, and for thy hired
servant and for thy stranger that sojourn with thee;
and for thy cattle, and for the beasts that are in thy
land, shall all the increase thereof be for food."</p>

<p>That this cannot be regarded as merely a regulation
of a communistic character, designed simply to affirm
the absolute equality of all men in right to the product
of the soil, is evident from the fact that the beasts also
are included in the terms of the law. The object was
quite different, as we shall shortly see.</p>

<p>That it should be regarded as possible for a whole
people thus to live off the spontaneous produce of self-sowed
grain may seem incredible to us who dwell in
less propitious lands; and yet travellers tell us that in
the Palestine of to-day, with its rich soil and kindly
climate, the various food grains continuously propagate
themselves without cultivation; and that in Albania,
also, two and three successive harvests are sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
reaped as the result of one sowing. So, even apart
from the special blessing from the Lord promised to
them if they would obey this command, the supply of at
least the necessities of life was possible from the spontaneous
product of the sabbath of the land. Though
less than usual, it might easily be sufficient. In Deut.
xv. 1-11 it is ordered also that the seventh year should
be "a year of release" to the debtor; not indeed as
regards all debts, but loans only; nor, apparently, that
even these should be released absolutely, but that
throughout the seventh year the claim of the creditor
was to be in abeyance. The regulation may naturally
be regarded as consequent upon this fundamental law
regarding the sabbath of the land. The income of the
year being much less than usual, the debtor, presumably,
might often find it difficult to pay; whence
this restriction on collection of debt during this period.</p>

<p>The central thought of this ordinance then is this,
that man's right in the soil and its product, originally
granted from God, during this sabbatic year reverted to
the Giver; who, again, by ordering that all exclusive
rights of individuals in the produce of their estates
should be suspended for this year, placed, for so long,
the rich and the poor on an absolute equality as
regards means of sustenance.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Jubilee.</span></p>

<p class="center">xxv. 8-12.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven
times seven years; and there shall be unto thee the days of seven
sabbaths of years, even forty and nine years. Then shalt thou send
abroad the loud trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month; in
the day of atonement shall ye send abroad the trumpet throughout
all your land. And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim
liberty throughout the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
be a jubilee unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his
possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family. A jubilee
shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap
that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapes in it of the
undressed vines. For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy unto you: ye
shall eat the increase thereof out of the field."</p></blockquote>

<p>The remainder of this chapter, vv. 8-55, is occupied
with this ordinance of the jubilee year; an observance
absolutely without a parallel in any nation, and which
has to do with the solution of some of the most difficult
social problems, not only of that time, but also
of our own. Seven weeks of years, each terminating
with the sabbatic year of solemn rest for the land,
were to be numbered, <em>i.e.</em>, forty-nine full years, of
which the last was a sabbatic year, beginning, as
always, with the feast of atonement in the tenth day of
the seventh month. And then when, at its expiration,
the day of atonement came round again, at the beginning
of the fiftieth year of this reckoning, at the close,
as would appear, of the solemn expiatory ritual of the
day, throughout all the land of Israel the loud trumpet
was to be sounded, proclaiming "liberty throughout
the land unto all the inhabitants thereof." The ordinance
is given in vv. 8-12 above.</p>

<p>It appears that the liberty thus proclaimed was
threefold: (1) liberty to the man who, through the reverses
of life, had become dispossessed from his family
inheritance in the land, to return to it again; (2) liberty
to every Hebrew slave, so that in the jubilee he became
a free man again; (3) the liberty of release from toil in
the cultivation of the land,&mdash;a feature, in this case,
even more remarkable than in the sabbatic year, because
already one such sabbatic year had but just
closed when the jubilee year immediately succeeded.</p>

<p>Why this year should be called a jubilee (Heb. <i lang="he" xml:lang="he">yobel</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
is a vexed question, on which scholars are far from
unanimous; but as it is of no practical importance,
there is no need to enter on the discussion here. To
suppose that these enactments should have originated,
as the radical critics claim, in post-exilian days, when,
under the existing social and political conditions, their
observance was impossible, is utterly absurd.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Not
only so, but in view of the admitted neglect even
of the sabbatic year,&mdash;an ordinance certainly less
difficult to carry out in practice,&mdash;during four hundred
and ninety years of Israel's history, the supposition
that the law of the jubilee should have been first
promulgated at any earlier post-Mosaic period is
scarcely less incredible.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Jubilee and the Land.</span></p>

<p class="center">xxv. 13-28.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In this year of jubilee ye shall return every man unto his possession.
And if thou sell aught unto thy neighbour, or buy of thy neighbour's
hand, ye shall not wrong one another: according to the number of
years after the jubilee thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, and according
unto the number of years of the crops he shall sell unto thee. According
to the multitude of the years thou shalt increase the price thereof,
and according to the fewness of the years thou shalt diminish the
price of it; for the number of the crops doth he sell unto thee. And
ye shall not wrong one another; but thou shalt fear thy God: for I
am the Lord your God. Wherefore ye shall do My statutes, and keep
My judgments and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.
And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
therein in safety. And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh
year? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase: then I
will command My blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall
bring forth fruit for the three years. And ye shall sow the eighth
year, and eat of the fruits, the old store; until the ninth year, until
her fruits come in, ye shall eat the old store. And the land shall not
be sold in perpetuity; for the land is Mine: for ye are strangers and
sojourners with Me. And in all the land of your possession ye shall
grant a redemption for the land. If thy brother be waxen poor, and
sell some of his possession, then shall his kinsman that is next unto
him come, and shall redeem that which his brother hath sold. And
if a man have no one to redeem it, and he be waxen rich and find
sufficient to redeem it; then let him count the years of the sale thereof,
and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; and he
shall return unto his possession. But if he be not able to get it back
for himself, then that which he hath sold shall remain in the hand
of him that hath bought it until the year of jubilee: and in the jubilee
it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession."</p></blockquote>

<p>The remainder of the chapter (vv. 13-55) deals with
the practical application of this law of the jubilee to
various cases. In vv. 13-28 we have the application
of the law to the case of property in <em>land</em>; in vv. 29-34,
to sales of <em>dwelling houses</em>; and the remaining verses
(35-55) deal with the application of this law to the
institution of <em>slavery</em>.</p>

<p>As regards the first matter, the transfers of right in
land, these in all cases were to be governed by the
fundamental principle enounced in ver. 23: "The land
shall not be sold in perpetuity; for the land is Mine:
for ye are strangers and sojourners with Me."</p>

<p>Thus in the theocracy there was no such thing as
either private or communal ownership in land. Just as
in some lands to-day the only owner of the land is the
king, so it was in Israel; but in this case the King was
Jehovah. From this it follows, evidently, that properly
speaking, according to this law, there could be no such
thing in Israel as a sale or purchase of land. All that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
any man could buy or sell was the right to its products,
and that, again, only for a limited time; for every fiftieth
year the land was to revert to the family to whom its
use had been originally assigned. Hence the regulations
(vv. 14-19) regarding such transfers of the right to
the use of the land. They are all governed by the simple
and equitable principle that the price paid for the usufruct
of the land was to be exactly proportioned to the
number of years which were to elapse between the
date of the sale and the reversion of the land, which
would take place in the jubilee. Thus, the price for such
transfer of right in the first year of the jubilee period
would be at its maximum, because the sale covered the
right to the produce of the land for forty-nine years;
while, on the other hand, in the case of a transfer
made in the forty-eighth year, the price would have
fallen to a very small amount, as only the product of
one year's cultivation remained to be sold, and after
the ensuing sabbatic year the land would revert in the
jubilee to the original holder. The command to keep
in mind this principle, and not wrong one another, is
enforced (vv. 17-19) by the injunction to do this because
of the fear of God; and by the promise that if Israel
will obey this law, they shall dwell in safety, and have
abundance.</p>

<p>In vv. 24-28, after the declaration of the fundamental
law that the land belongs only to the Lord, and that
they are to regard themselves as simply His tenants,
"sojourners with Him," a second application of the
law is made. First, it is ordered that in every case,
and without reference to the year of jubilee, every
landholder who through stress of poverty may be
obliged to sell the usufruct of his land shall retain the
right to redeem it. Three cases are assumed. First<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
(ver. 25), it is ordered that if the poor man have lost
his land, and have a kinsman who is able to redeem
it, he shall do so. Secondly (ver. 26), if he have no
such kinsman, but himself become able to redeem it,
it shall be his privilege to do so. In both cases alike,
"the overplus," <em>i.e.</em>, the value of the land for the years
still remaining till the jubilee, for which the purchaser
had paid, is to be restored to him, and then the land
reverts at once, without waiting for the jubilee, to the
original proprietor. The third case (ver. 28) is that of
the poor man who has no kinsman to buy back his
landholding, and never becomes able to do so himself.
In such a case, the purchaser was to hold it until the
jubilee year, when the land reverted without compensation
to the family of the poor man who had
transferred it. That this was strictly equitable is
self-evident, when we remember that, according to
the law previously laid down, the purchaser had only
paid for the value of the product of the land until the
jubilee year; and when he had received its produce
for that time, naturally and in strict equity his right
in the land terminated.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Jubilee and Dwelling Houses.</span></p>

<p class="center">xxv. 29-34.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may
redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; for a full year shall he
have the right of redemption. And if it be not redeemed within the
space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be
made sure in perpetuity to him that bought it, throughout his generations:
it shall not go out in the jubilee. But the houses of the villages
which have no wall round about them shall be reckoned with the
fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out
in the jubilee. Nevertheless the cities of the Levites, the houses of the
cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time. And
if one of the Levites redeem [not], then the house that was sold, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
city of his possession, shall go out in the jubilee: for the houses of the
cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel.
But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is
their perpetual possession."</p></blockquote>

<p>In vv. 29-34 is considered the application of the
jubilee ordinance to the sale of dwelling houses: first
(vv. 29-31), to such sale in case of the people generally;
secondly (vv. 32-34), to sales of houses by the Levites.
Under the former head we have first the law as regards
sales of dwelling houses in "walled cities;" to which
it is ordered that the law of reversion in the jubilee shall
not apply, and for which the right of redemption was
only to hold valid for one year. The obvious reason
for exempting houses in cities from the law of reversion
is that the law has to do only with land such as
may be used in a pastoral or agricultural way for man's
support. And this explains why, on the other hand,
it is next ordered (ver. 31) that in the case of houses
in unwalled villages the law of redemption and reversion
in the jubilee shall apply as well as to the land.
For the inhabitants of the villages were the herdsmen
and cultivators of the soil; and the house was regarded
rightly as a necessary attachment to the land, without
which its use would not be possible. But inasmuch as
God had assigned no landholding to the Levites in the
original distribution of the land,&mdash;and apart from their
houses they had no possession (ver. 33),&mdash;in order to
secure them in the privilege of a permanent holding, such
as others enjoyed in their lands, it was ordered that in
their case their houses, as being their only possession
in real estate, should be treated as were the landholdings
of members of the other tribes.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span></p>
<p>The relation of the jubilee law to personal rights in
the land having been thus determined and expounded,
in the next place (vv. 35-55) is considered the application
of the law to slavery. Quite naturally, this section
begins (vv. 35-37) with a general injunction to assist
and deal mercifully with any brother who has become
poor. "If thy brother be waxen poor, and his hand
fail with thee; then thou shalt uphold him: as a
stranger and a sojourner shall he live with thee. Take
thou no usury of him or increase; but fear thy God:
that thy brother may live with thee. Thou shalt not
give him thy money upon usury, nor give him thy
victuals for increase."</p>

<p>The evident object of this law is to prevent, as far
as possible, that extreme of poverty which might compel
a man to sell himself in order to live. Debt is a burden
in any case, to a poor man especially; but debt is the
heavier burden when to the original debt is added
the constant payment of interest. Hence, not merely
"usury" in the modern sense of <em>excessive</em> interest, but
it is forbidden to claim or take any interest whatever
from any Hebrew debtor. On the same principle, it is
forbidden to take increase for food which may be lent to
a poor brother; as when one lets a man have twenty
bushels of wheat on condition that in due time he shall
return for it twenty-two. This command is enforced
(ver. 38) by reminding them from whom they have
received what they have, and on what easy terms, as
a gift; from their covenant God, who is Himself their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
security that by so doing they shall not lose: "I am
the Lord your God, which brought you forth out of the
land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, to be
your God." They need not therefore have recourse to
the exaction of interest and increase from their poor
brethren in order to make a living, but are to be
merciful, even as Jehovah their God is merciful.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Jubilee and Slavery.</span></p>

<p class="center">xxv. 39-55.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And if thy brother be waxen poor with thee, and sell himself
unto thee; thou shalt not make him to serve as a bondservant: as
an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with thee; he shall
serve with thee unto the year of jubilee: then shall he go out from
thee, he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own
family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return. For
they are My servants, which I brought forth out of the land of
Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen. Thou shalt not rule
over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy God. And as for thy
bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have; of the nations
that are round about you, of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.
Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn
among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with
you, which they have begotten in your land: and they shall be your
possession. And ye shall make them an inheritance for your
children after you, to hold for a possession; of them shall ye take
your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of
Israel ye shall not rule, one over another, with rigour. And if a
stranger or sojourner with thee be waxen rich, and thy brother
be waxen poor beside him, and sell himself unto the stranger or
sojourner with thee, or to the stock of the stranger's family: after
that he is sold he may be redeemed; one of his brethren may
redeem him: or his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or
any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or
if he be waxen rich, he may redeem himself. And he shall reckon
with him that bought him from the year that he sold himself to him
unto the year of jubilee: and the price of his sale shall be according
unto the number of years; according to the time of an hired servant
shall he be with him. If there be yet many years, according unto
them he shall give back the price of his redemption out of the money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
that he was bought for. And if there remain but few years unto the
year of jubilee, then he shall reckon with him; according unto his
years shall he give back the price of his redemption. As a servant
hired year by year shall he be with him: he shall not rule with
rigour over him in thy sight. And if he be not redeemed by these
means, then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, he, and his children
with him. For unto Me the children of Israel are servants; they are
My servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am the
Lord your God."</p></blockquote>

<p>Even with the burdensomeness of debt lightened
as above, it was yet possible that a man might be
reduced to poverty so extreme that he should feel
compelled to sell himself as a slave. Hence arises
the question of slavery, and its relation to the law of
the jubilee. Under this head two cases were possible:
the first, where a man had sold himself to a fellow-Hebrew
(vv. 39-46); the second, where a man had
sold himself to a foreigner resident in the land (vv.
47-55).</p>

<p>With the Hebrews and all the neighbouring peoples,
slavery was, and had been from of old, a settled institution.
Regarded simply as an abstract question of
morals, it might seem as if the Lord might once for
all have abolished it by an absolute prohibition; after
the manner in which many modern reformers would
deal with such evils as the liquor traffic, etc. But the
Lord was wiser than many such. As has been remarked
already, in connection with the question of concubinage,
that law is not in every case the best which may be
the best intrinsically and ideally. That law is the
best which can be best enforced in the actual moral
status of the people, and consequent condition of public
opinion. So the Lord did not at once prohibit slavery;
but He ordained laws which would restrict it, and modify
and ameliorate the condition of the slave wherever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
slavery was permitted to exist; laws, moreover, which
have had such an educational power as to have banished
slavery from the Hebrew people.</p>

<p>In the first place, slavery, in the unqualified sense
of the word, is allowed only in the case of non-Israelites.
That it was permitted to hold these as
bondmen is explicitly declared (vv. 44-46). It is,
however, important, in order to form a correct idea
of Hebrew slavery, to observe that, according to Exod.
xxi. 16, man-stealing was made a capital offence; and
the law also carefully guarded from violence and tyranny
on the part of the master the non-Israelite slave lawfully
gotten, even decreeing his emancipation from his
master in extreme cases of this kind (Exod. xxi. 20, 21,
26, 27).</p>

<p>With regard to the Hebrew bondman, the law
recognises no property of the master in his person;
that a servant of Jehovah should be a slave of another
servant of Jehovah is denied; because they are His
servants, no other can own them (vv. 42, 55). Thus,
while the case is supposed (ver. 39) that a man through
stress of poverty may sell himself to a fellow-Hebrew
as a bondservant, the sale is held as affecting only the
master's right to his service, but not to his person.
"Thou shalt not make him to serve as a bondservant:
as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with
thee."</p>

<p>Further, it is elsewhere provided (Exod. xxi. 2) that
in no case shall such sale hold valid for a longer time
than six years; in the seventh year the man was to
have the privilege of going out free for nothing. And
in this chapter is added a further alleviation of the
bondage (vv. 40, 41): "He shall serve with thee unto
the year of jubilee: then shall he go out from thee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
he and his children with him, and shall return unto
his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers
shall he return. For they are My servants, which I
brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not
be sold as bondmen."</p>

<p>That is, if it so happened that before the six years
of his prescribed service had been completed the jubilee
year came in, he was to be exempted from the obligation
to service for the remainder of that period.</p>

<p>The remaining verses of this part of the law (vv.
44-46) provide that the Israelite may take to himself
bondmen of "the children of the strangers" that sojourn
among them; and that to such the law of the periodic
release shall not be held to apply. Such are "bondmen
for ever." "Ye shall make them an inheritance for
your children after you, to hold for a possession; of
them shall ye take your bondmen for ever."</p>

<p>It is to be borne in mind that even in such cases
the law which commanded the kind treatment of all the
strangers in the land (xix. 33, 34) would apply; so
that even where permanent slavery was allowed it
was placed under humanising restriction.</p>

<p>In vv. 47-55 is taken up, finally, the case where
a poor Israelite should have sold himself as a slave
to a foreigner resident in the land. In all such cases
it is ordered that the owner of the man must recognise
the right of redemption. That is, it was the privilege
of the man himself, or of any of his near kindred, to
buy him out of bondage. Compensation to the owner
however, enjoined in such cases according to the
number of the years remaining to the next jubilee, at
which time he would be obliged to release him (ver. 54),
whether redeemed or not. Thus we read (vv. 50-52):
"He shall reckon with him that bought him from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
year that he sold himself to him unto the year of jubilee:
and the price of his sale shall be according unto the
number of years; according to the time of an hired
servant shall he be with him. If there be yet many
years, according unto them he shall give back the price
of his redemption out of the money that he was bought
for. And if there remain but few years unto the year
of jubilee, then he shall reckon with him; according unto
his years shall he give back the price of his redemption.
As a servant hired year by year shall he be with him."</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is commanded (ver. 53) that the
owner of the Israelite, for so long time as he may
remain in bondage, shall "not rule over him with
rigour;" and by the addition of the words "in thy
sight" it is intimated that God would hold the collective
nation responsible for seeing that no oppression was
exercised by any alien over any of their enslaved
brethren. To which it should also be added, finally,
that the regulations for the release of the slave carefully
provided for the maintenance of the family relation.
Families were not to be parted in the emancipation of
the jubilee; the man who went out free was to take his
children with him (vv. 41, 54). In the case, however,
where the wife had been given him by his master, she
and her children remained in bondage after his emancipation
in the seventh year; but of course only until
she had reached her seventh year of service. But if
the slave already had his wife when he became a slave,
then she and their children went out with him in the
seventh year (Exod. xxi. 3, 4). The contrast in the spirit
of these laws with that of the institution of slavery as
it formerly existed in the Southern States of America
and elsewhere in Christendom, is obvious.</p>

<p>These, then, were the regulations connected with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
application of the ordinance of the jubilee year to rights
of property, whether in real estate or in slaves. In
respect to the cessation from the cultivation of the soil
which was enjoined for the year, the law was essentially
the same as that for the sabbatic year, except that,
apparently, the right of property in the spontaneous
produce of the land, which was in abeyance in the
former case, was in so far recognised in the latter that
each man was allowed to "eat the increase of the jubilee
year out of the field" (ver. 12).</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Practical Objects of the Sabbatic Year and
Jubilee Law.</span></p>

<p>Such was this extraordinary legislation, the like
of which will be sought in vain in any other people.
It is indeed true that, in some instances, ancient lawgivers
decreed that land should not be permanently
alienated, or that individuals should not hold more
than a certain amount of land. Thus, for example, the
Lacedemonians were forbidden to sell their lands, and
the Dalmatians were wont to redistribute their lands
every eight years. But laws such as these only present
accidental coincidences with single features of the
jubilee year; an agreement to be accounted for by the
fact that the aim of such lawgivers was, in so far, the
same as that of the Hebrew code, that they sought thus
to guard against excessive accumulations of property
in the hands of individuals, and those consequent great
inequalities in the distribution of wealth which, in all
lands and ages, and never more clearly than in our
own, have been seen to be fraught with the gravest
dangers to the highest interests of society. Beyond
this single point we shall search in vain the history of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
any other people for an analogy to these laws concerning
the sabbatic and the jubilee year.</p>

<p>What was the immediate object of this remarkable
legislation? It is not irrelevant to observe that in so
far as regards the prescription of a periodic rest to the
land, agricultural science recognises that this is an
advantage, especially in places where it may be difficult
to obtain fertilisers for the soil in adequate amount. But
it cannot be supposed that this was the chief object of
these ordinances, not even in so far as they had respect
to the land. We shall not err in regarding them as
intended, like all in the Levitical system, to make Israel
to be in reality, what they were called to be, a people
holy, <em>i.e.</em>, fully consecrated to the Lord. The bearing
of these laws on this end is not hard to perceive.</p>

<p>In the first place, the law of the sabbatic year and
the jubilee was a most impressive lesson as to the relation
of God to what men call their property; and, in
particular, as to His relation to man's property in land.
By these ordinances every Israelite was to be reminded
in a most impressive way that the land which he tilled,
or on which he fed his flocks and herds, belonged, not
to himself, but to God. Just as God taught him that
his time belonged to Him, by putting in a claim for the
absolute consecration to Himself of every seventh day,
so here He reminded Israel that the land belonged to
Him, by asserting a similar claim on the land every
seventh year, and twice in a century for two years
in succession.</p>

<p>No one will pretend that the law of the sabbatic year
or the jubilee is binding on communities now. But it
is a question for our times as to whether the basal
principle regarding the relation of God to land, and
by necessary consequence the right of man regarding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
land, which is fundamental to these laws, is not in its
very nature of perpetual force. Surely, there is nothing
in Scripture to suggest that God's ownership of the
land was limited to the land of Palestine, or to that
land only during Israel's occupancy of it. Instead of
this, Jehovah everywhere represents Himself as having
given the land to Israel, and therefore by necessary
implication as having a like right over it while as
yet the Canaanites were dwelling in it. Again, the
purpose of God's dealing with Egypt is said to be
that Pharaoh might know this same truth: that the
earth (or land) was the Lord's (Exod. ix. 29); and in
Psalm xxiv. 1 it is stated, as a broad truth, without
qualification or restriction, that the earth is the Lord's,
as well as that which fills it. It is true that there is
no suggestion in any of these passages that the relation
of God to the earth or to the land is different from
His relation to other property; but it is intended to
emphasise the fact that in the use of land, as of all else,
we are to regard ourselves as God's stewards, and hold
and use it as in trust from Him.</p>

<p>The vital relation of this great truth to the burning
questions of our day regarding the rights of men in
land is self-evident. It does not indeed determine
how the land question should be dealt with in any
particular country, but it does settle it that if in these
matters we will act in the fear of God, we must keep
this principle steadily before us, that, primarily, the land
belongs to the Lord, and is to be used accordingly.
How, as a matter of fact, God did order that the land
should be used, in the only instance when He has condescended
Himself to order the political government
of a nation, we have already seen, and shall presently
consider more fully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span></p>

<p>It is obvious that the natural and therefore intended
effect of these regulations, if obeyed, would have been
to impose a constant and powerful check upon man's
natural covetousness and greed of gain. Every seventh
year the Hebrew was to pause in his toil for wealth,
and for one whole year he was to waive even his
ordinary right to the spontaneous produce of his fields;
which year of abstinence from sowing and reaping once
in fifty years was doubled. Add to this the strict prohibition
of lending money upon interest to a fellow-Israelite,
and we can see how far-reaching and effective,
if obeyed, were such regulations likely to be in
restraining that insatiate greed for riches which ever
grows the more by that which feeds it.</p>

<p>Yet again; the law of the sabbatic year and the
jubilee was adapted to serve also as a singularly powerful
discipline in that faith toward God which is the soul
of all true religion. In this practical way every Hebrew
was to be taught that "man doth not live by bread
alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the
mouth of God." The lesson is ever hard to learn,
though none the less necessary. This thought is
alluded to in ver. 20, where it is supposed that a man
might raise the very natural objection to these laws,
"What shall we eat the seventh year?" To which
the answer is given, with reference even to the extreme
case of the jubilee year: "I will command My blessing
upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth
fruit for the three years; until the ninth year ... ye
shall eat the old store."</p>

<p>But probably the most prominent and important
object of the regulations in this chapter was to secure,
as far as possible, the equal distribution of wealth, by
preventing excessive accumulations either of land or of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
capital in the hands of a few, while the mass should be
sunk in poverty. It is certain that these laws, if carried
out, would have had a marvellous effect in this respect.
As for capital, we all know what an important factor in
the production of wealth is accumulation by interest
on loans, especially when the interest is constantly
compounded. There can be no doubt of its immense
power as an instrument for at once enriching the lender
and in proportion impoverishing the borrower. But
among the Israelites, to receive interest or its equivalent
was prohibited. One other chief cause of the excessive
wealth of individuals among us, as in all ages, is the
acquirement in perpetuity by individuals of a disproportionate
amount of the public land. The condition
of things in the United Kingdom is familiar to all, with
its inevitable effect on the condition of large masses of
people; and in parts of the United States there are
indications of a like tendency working toward the similar
disadvantage of many small landholders and cultivators.
But in Israel, if these laws should be carried into effect,
such a state of things, so often witnessed among other
nations, was made for ever impossible. Individual
ownership in the land itself was forbidden; no man
was allowed more than a leasehold right; nor could he,
even by adding largely to his leaseholds, increase his
wealth indefinitely, so as to transmit a fortune to his
children, to be still further augmented by a similar
process in the next and succeeding generations; for
every fifty years the jubilee came around, and whatever
leaseholds he might have acquired from less fortunate
brethren, reverted unconditionally to the original owner
or his legal heirs.</p>

<p>However impracticable such arrangements may seem
to us under the conditions of modern life, yet it must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
be confessed that in the case of a nation just starting
on its career in a new country, as was Israel at that
time, nothing could well be thought of more likely to
be effective toward securing, along with careful regard
to the rights of property, an equal distribution of wealth
among the people, than the legislation which is placed
before us in this chapter.</p>

<p>It deserves to be specially noticed by how exact
equity the laws are distinguished. While, on the one
hand, excessive accumulations, either of capital or of
land, were thus made impossible, there is here nothing
of the destructive communism advocated by many in
our day. These laws put no premium on laziness; for
if a man, through indolence or vice, was compelled to
sell out his right in his land, he had no security of
obtaining it again until the jubilee; that is to say, upon
an average, during his working lifetime. On the other
hand, encouragement was given to industry, as a man
who was thrifty might, by purchase of leaseholds,
materially increase his wealth and comfort in life.
And the effect on inheritance is evident. There could,
on the one hand, be no inheritance of such colossal
and overgrown fortunes as are possible in our modern
states,&mdash;no blessing, certainly, in many cases, to the
heirs; and neither, on the other hand, could there be
any inheritance of hopeless and degrading poverty. A
man might have had an indolent or a vicious father,
who had thus forfeited his landholding; but while the
father would doubtless suffer deserved poverty during
his active life, the young man, when the jubilee returned,
and the lost paternal inheritance reverted to
him, would have the opportunity to see whether he
might not, with his father's experience before him as
a warning, do better, and retrieve the fortunes of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
family. In any case, he would not start upon the
work of life weighted, as are multitudes among us, with
a crushing and almost irremovable burden of poverty.</p>

<p>It is certain, no doubt, that these laws are not morally
binding now; and no less certain, probably, that failing,
as they did, to secure observance in Israel, such laws,
even if enacted, could not in our day be practically
carried out any more than then. Nevertheless, so much
we may safely say, that the intention and aim of these
laws as regards the equal distribution of wealth in the
community ought to be the aim of all wise legislation
now. It is certain that all good government ought to
seek in all righteous and equitable ways to prevent the
formation in the community of classes, either of the
excessively rich or of the excessively poor. Absolute
equality in this respect is doubtless unattainable, and
in a world intended for purposes of moral training and
discipline were even undesirable; but extreme wealth
or extreme poverty are certainly evils to the prevention
of which our legislators may well give their minds.
Only it needs also to be kept in mind that these
Hebrew laws no less distinctly teach us that this end
is to be sought only in such a way as shall neither, on
the one hand, put a premium on laziness and vice, nor,
on the other, deny to the virtuous and industrious the
advantage which industry and virtue deserve, of additional
wealth, comfort, and exemption from toilsome
drudgery.</p>

<p>In close connection with all this it will be observed
that all this legislation, while guarding the rights of the
rich, is evidently inspired by that same merciful regard
for the poor which marks the Levitical law throughout.
For in all these regulations it is assumed that there
would still be poor in the land; but the law secured to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
the poor great mitigations of poverty. Every seventh
year the produce of the land was to be free alike to all;
if one were poor his brother was to uphold him; when
lending him, he was not to add to the debt the burden
of interest or increase. And then there was to the
poor man the ever-present assurance, which alone
would take off half the bitterness of poverty, that
through the coming of the jubilee the children at least
would have a new chance, and start life on an equality,
in respect of inheritance in land, with the sons of the
richest. And when we remember the close connection
between extreme poverty and every variety of crime,
it is plain that the whole legislation is as admirably
adapted to the prevention of crime as of abject and
hopeless poverty. Well might Asaph use the words
which he employs, with evident allusion to the trumpet
sound which ushered in the jubilee: "Happy the
people that know the joyful sound!" <em>i.e.</em>, that have the
blessed experience of the jubilee, that supreme earthly
sabbatism of the people of God.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>Most significant and full of instruction, no less to us
than to Israel, was the ordinance that both the sabbatic
and the jubilee years should date from the day of
Atonement. It was when, having completed the solemn
ritual of that day, the high priest put on again his
beautiful garments and came forth, having made atonement
for all the transgressions of Israel, that the
trumpet of the jubilee was to be sounded. Thus was
Israel reminded in the most impressive manner possible
that all these social, civil, and communal blessings were
possible only on condition of reconciliation with God
through atoning blood; atonement in the highest and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
fullest sense, which should reach even to the Holy of
Holies, and place the blood on the very mercy-seat of
Jehovah. This is true still, though the nations have
yet to learn it. The salvation of nations, no less than
that of individuals, is conditioned by national fellowship
with God, secured through the great Atonement of the
Lord. Not until the nations learn this lesson may we
expect to see the crying evils of the earth removed, or
the questions of property, of land-holding, of capital
and labour, justly and happily solved.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Typical Significance of the Sabbatic and
Jubilee Years.</span></p>

<p>But we must not forget that the sabbatic year and
the year of jubilee, following the seventh seven of years,
are the two last members of a sabbatic system of
septenary periods, namely, the sabbath of the seventh
day, the feast of Pentecost, following the expiry of the
seventh week from Passover, and then the still more
sacred seventh month, with its two great feasts, and
the day of atonement intervening. But, as we have
seen, we have good scriptural authority for regarding
all these as typical. Each in succession brings out
another stage or aspect of the great Messianic redemption,
in a progressive revelation historically unfolding.
In all of these alike we have been able to trace thoughts
connected with the sabbatic idea, as pointing forward
to the final rest, redemption, and consummated restoration,
the sabbatism that remaineth to the people of God.
To these preceding sabbatic periods these last two are
closely related. Both alike began on the great day of
atonement, in which all Israel was to afflict their souls
in penitence for sin; and on that day they both began
when the high priest came out from within the veil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
where, from the time of his offering the sin-offering, he
had been hidden from the sight of Israel for a season;
and both alike were ushered in with a trumpet blast.</p>

<p>We shall hardly go amiss if we see in both of these&mdash;first
in the sabbatic year, and still more clearly in the
year of jubilee&mdash;a prophetic foreshadowing in type of
that final repentance of the children of Israel in the
latter days, and their consequent re-establishment in their
land, which the prophets so fully and explicitly predict.
In that day they are to return, as the prophets bear
witness, every man to the land which the Lord gave
for an inheritance to their fathers. Indeed, one might
say with truth that even the lesser restoration from
Babylon was prefigured in this ordinance; but, without
doubt, its chief and supreme reference must be to that
greater restoration still in the future, of which we read,
for example, in Isa. xi. 11, when "the Lord shall set
His hand again the <em>second</em> time to recover the remnant
of His people, which shall remain, from Assyria, and
from Egypt, ... and from the islands of the sea."</p>

<p>But the typical reference of these sacred years of
sabbatism reaches yet beyond what pertains to Israel
alone. For not only, according to the prophets and
apostles, is there to be a restoration of Israel, but also,
as the Apostle Peter declared to the Jews (Acts iii.
19-21), closely connected with and consequent on
this, a "restoration of all things." And it is in this
great, final, and exceedingly glorious restoration of the
time of the end that we recognise the ultimate antitype
of these sabbatic seasons. When read in the light of
later predictions they appear to point forward with
singular distinctness to what, according to the Holy
Word, shall be when Jesus Christ, the heavenly High
Priest, shall come forth from within the veil; when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
last trumpet shall sound, and He who was "once offered
to bear the sins of many" shall appear a second time,
apart from sin, to them that wait for Him, unto salvation
(Heb. ix. 28).</p>

<p>Even in the beginning of the Pentateuch (Gen. iii.
17-19) it is explicitly taught that because of Adam's
sin, the curse of God, in some mysterious way, fell
even upon the material earthly creation. We read
that the Lord said unto Adam: "Cursed is the ground
for thy sake; in toil shalt thou eat of it all the days of
thy life; thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth
to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; in
the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou
return unto the ground." It is because of sin, then,
that man is doomed to labour, toilsome and imperfectly
requited by an unwilling soil. It lies immediately
before us that both the sabbatic year and the year of
jubilee, by the ordinance regarding the rest for the
land, and the special promise of sufficiency without exhausting
labour, involved for Israel a temporary suspension
of the full operation of this curse. The ordinance
therefore points unmistakably in a prophetic way to
what the New Testament explicitly predicts&mdash;the
coming of a day when, with man redeemed, material
nature also shall share the great deliverance. In a
word, in the sabbatic year, and in a yet higher form in
the year of jubilee, we have in symbol the wonderful
truth which in the most didactic language is formally
declared by the Apostle Paul in these words (Rom.
viii. 19-22): "The earnest expectation of the creation
waiteth for the revealing of the sons of God. For the
creation was subjected to vanity, not of its own will,
but by reason of him who subjected it, in hope that the
creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children
of God. For we know that the whole creation groaneth
and travaileth in pain together until now."</p>

<p>The jubilee year contained in type all this, and more.
Where the sabbatic year had typically pointed only to
a coming rest of the earth from the primeval curse,
the jubilee, falling, not on a seventh, but on an eighth
year, following immediately on the sabbatic seventh,
pointed also to the permanence of this blessed condition.
It is the festival, by eminence, of the new
creation, of paradise completely and for ever restored.</p>

<p>Moreover, as falling in the fiftieth year, and therefore
on an eighth year of the sabbatic calendar, the
jubilee was to the week of years as the Lord's day
to the week of days. Like that, it is the festival of
resurrection. This is as clearly foreshadowed in the
type as the other. For in the year of jubilee not only
was the land to rest, but every bond-slave was to be
released, and to return to his inheritance and to his
family. In the light of what has preceded, and of other
revelations of Scripture, we can hardly miss of perceiving
the typical meaning of this. For what is the great
event which the Apostle Paul, in the passage just
cited, associates in time with the deliverance of the
earthly creation, but "the redemption of the body," as
the final issue of the atoning work of Christ? For as
yet even believers are in bondage to death and the
grave; but the day which is coming, the day of earth's
redemption, shall bring to all that are Christ's, all that
are Israelites indeed, deliverance "from the bondage
of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children
of God."</p>

<p>And as the slave who was freed in the year of
jubilee therewith also returned to his forfeited inheritance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
so also shall it be in that day. For precisely
this is given us by the Holy Spirit in the New Testament
(1 Peter i. 4, 5), as another aspect of the day when
the heavenly Aaron shall come forth from the Holiest.
For we are begotten <em>unto an inheritance</em>, reserved in
heaven for us, "who by the power of God are guarded
through faith unto a salvation ready to be revealed
in the last time." Cast out through death from the
inheritance of the earth, which in the beginning was
given by God to our first father, and to his seed in him,
but which was lost to him and to his children through
his sin, the great jubilee of the future shall bring us
again, every man who is in Christ by faith, into the
lost inheritance, redeemed and glorified citizens of a
redeemed and glorified earth. Hence it is that in
Rev. xxii. we are shown in vision, first, the new earth,
delivered from the curse, and then the New Jerusalem,
the Church of the risen and glorified saints of God,
descending from God out of heaven, to assume possession
of the purchased inheritance.</p>

<p>And the law adds also: "Ye shall return every
man unto his family;" which gives the last feature
here prefigured of that supreme sabbatism which
remaineth for the people of God (Heb. iv. 9). It
shall bring the reunion of those who had been parted
and scattered. The day of resurrection is accordingly
spoken of (2 Thess. ii. 1) as a day of "gathering together"
of all who, though one in Christ, have been
rudely parted by death. And yet more, it will be
"the day of our gathering together unto Him," even
the blessed Lord Jesus Christ, the "<i>Goel</i>," the Kinsman-Redeemer
of the ruined bondsmen and their lost
inheritance: "Whom not having seen, we love," but
then expect to see even as He is, and beholding Him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
be like Him, and be with Him for ever and for ever.
Who should not long for the day?&mdash;the day when for
the first time, this last type of Leviticus shall pass into
complete fulfilment in the antitype; the day of "the
restoration of all things;" the day of the deliverance
of the material creation from her present bondage
to corruption; the day also of the release of every
true Israelite from the bondage of death, and the
eternal establishment of all such with the Elder Brother,
the First-begotten, in the enjoyment of the inheritance
of the saints in light.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.</a></h2>

<h3><em>THE PROMISES AND THREATS OF THE COVENANT.</em></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lev.</span> xxvi. 1-46.</p>


<p>One would have expected that this chapter would
have been the last in the book of Leviticus, for
it forms a natural and fitting close to the whole law as
hitherto recorded. But whatever may have been the
reason of its present literary form, the fact remains
that while this chapter is, in outward form, the conclusion
of the Levitical law, another chapter follows it
in the manner of an appendix.</p>

<p>Chapter xxvi. opens with these words (vv. 1, 2):
"Ye shall make you no idols, neither shall ye rear you
up a graven image, or a pillar, neither shall ye place
any figured stone in your land, to bow down unto it:
for I am the Lord your God. Ye shall keep My
sabbaths, and reverence My sanctuary: I am the
Lord."</p>

<p>These verses, as they stand in the English versions
as a preface to this chapter, at first sight seem but
distantly related to what follows; and the Chaldee
paraphrast and others have therefore appended them
to the preceding chapter. But with that they have
even less evident connection. The thought of the editor
of this part of the canon, however, seems to have been
that the three commands which are here repeated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
might be regarded as presenting a compendious summary,
in its fundamental principles, of the whole law,
the promises and threatenings attached to which
immediately follow. And the more we think upon
these commands and what they involve, the more
evident will appear the fitness of their selection from
the whole law to introduce this chapter.</p>

<p>The commands which are here repeated are three:
namely, (1) a detailed prohibition of idolatry in the
forms then chiefly prevalent; (2) an injunction to
observe God's sabbaths; and (3) to reverence His
sanctuary. Inasmuch as the various forms of idol-worship,
which are here forbidden, all involved the
recognition of gods other than Jehovah, it is plain
that ver. 1 is in effect inclusive of the first and second
commandments of the decalogue. The injunction to
keep God's sabbaths, although in principle including
all the sabbatic times previously appointed, evidently
refers especially to the weekly sabbath of the fourth
commandment; while the command to reverence the
sanctuary of Jehovah covers in principle the ground of
the third. And thus, in fact, these three injunctions
essentially include the four commands of the decalogue
which have to do with man's duty to God, and are thus
fundamental to all other duties, both to God and man.
Very appropriately, then, are these verses given here
as a brief summary of the law to which the following
promises and threatenings are annexed. And their
suitableness to that which follows is the more clear
when we remember that the weekly sabbath, in particular,
is elsewhere (Exod. xxxi. 12-17) declared to be
a sign of God's covenant with Israel, to which these
promises and threats belong; and that the presence of
Jehovah's sanctuary also, which they are here charged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
to reverence, was a continual visible witness among
them of the special presence of God in Israel in
pursuance of that covenant.</p>

<p>After this pertinent summation of the most fundamental
commands of the law, the remainder of the
chapter contains, first (vv. 3-13), promises of blessing
from God, in case they shall obey this law; secondly
(vv. 14-39), threats of chastising judgment, in case they
disobey; and, thirdly (vv. 40-45), a prediction of
their final repentance, and promise of their gracious
restoration thereupon to the favour of God, and the
everlasting endurance of God's covenant to preserve
them in existence as a nation. The chapter then closes
(ver. 46) with the declaration: "These are the statutes
and judgments and laws, which the Lord made between
Him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the
hand of Moses."</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Promises of the Covenant.</span></p>

<p class="center">xxvi. 3-13.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If ye walk in My statutes, and keep My commandments, and do
them; then I will give you rains in their season, and the land shall
yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.
And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage
shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to
the full, and dwell in your land safely. And I will give peace in the
land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I
will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land, neither shall the sword
go through your land. And ye shall chase your enemies, and they
shall fall before you by the sword. And five of you shall chase an
hundred, and an hundred of you shall chase ten thousand: and your
enemies shall fall before you by the sword. And I will have respect
unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you; and I will
establish My covenant with you. And ye shall eat old store long
kept, and ye shall bring forth the old because of the new. And I will
set My tabernacle among you: and My soul shall not abhor you. And
I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
people. I am the Lord your God, which brought you forth out of the
land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have
broken the bars of your yoke, and made you go upright."</p></blockquote>

<p>The promises of the covenant are thus to the effect that
if Israel shall keep the law, God will give them rain and
fruitful seasons, harvests so abundant that the "threshing
shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall
reach unto the sowing time;" internal security; deliverance
from the wild beasts, which are still such a
scourge in many parts of the East; and such power
and spirit, that no enemy shall be able to stand before
them, but five of them shall chase an hundred, and an
hundred chase ten thousand. Then (ver. 9) is renewed
the promise, given long before to Abraham, of a great
increase in their numbers; and thereupon, very naturally,
is repeated the promise of abundant harvests, so that
notwithstanding they shall be so multiplied, one year's
harvest should not be consumed before it would have
to be removed from the granaries to make room for the
new (ver. 10). And then this section ends with the
assurance, which secures all other blessings, temporal
and spiritual, that God will abide among them in His
tabernacle, and will be their God, and they shall be
His people. And the fulfilment of all this is guaranteed
by the person, the purpose, and the past dealing
of the Promiser; Himself, Jehovah; His purpose, to
deliver them from bondage; and His past mercy, in
breaking the bands of their yoke.</p>


<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">The Vengeance of the Covenant</span>."</p>

<p class="center">xxvi. 14-46.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"But if ye will not hearken unto Me, and will not do all these commandments;
and if ye shall reject My statutes, and if your soul abhor
My judgments, so that ye will not do all My commandments, but break
My covenant; I also will do this unto you; I will appoint terror<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
over you, even consumption and fever, that shall consume the eyes,
and make the soul to pine away: and ye shall sow your seed in vain
for your enemies shall eat it. And I will set My face against you
and ye shall be smitten before your enemies: they that hate you
shall rule over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.
And if ye will not yet for these things hearken unto me, then I will
chastise you seven times more for your sins. And I will break the
pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your
earth as brass: and your strength shall be spent in vain: for your
land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land
yield their fruit. And if ye walk contrary unto Me, and will not
hearken unto Me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you
according to your sins. And I will send the beast of the field among
you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle,
and make you few in number; and your ways shall become desolate.
And if by these things ye will not be reformed unto Me,
but will walk contrary unto Me; then will I also walk contrary
unto you; and I will smite you, even I, seven times for your sins.
And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall execute the vengeance
of the covenant; and ye shall be gathered together within your
cities: and I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be
delivered into the hand of the enemy. When I break your staff
of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they
shall deliver your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not
be satisfied. And if ye will not for all this hearken unto Me, but
walk contrary unto Me; then I will walk contrary unto you in fury;
and I also will chastise you seven times for your sins. And ye shall
eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye
eat. And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your sun-images,
and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols; and
My soul shall abhor you. And I will make your cities a waste, and
will bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the
savour of your sweet odours. And I will bring the land into desolation:
and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.
And you will I scatter among the nations, and I will draw out the
sword after you: and your land shall be a desolation, and your
cities shall be a waste. Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as
long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies' land; even then
shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths. As long as it lieth
desolate it shall have rest; even the rest which it had not in your
sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it. And as for them that are left
of you I will send a faintness into their heart in the lands of their
enemies: and the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
they shall flee, as one fleeth from the sword; and they shall fall
when none pursueth. And they shall stumble one upon another, as
it were before the sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have
no power to stand before your enemies. And ye shall perish among
the nations, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up. And
they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your
enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they
pine away with them. And they shall confess their iniquity, and the
iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which they trespassed
against Me, and also that because they have walked contrary unto
Me, I also walked contrary unto them, and brought them into the
land of their enemies: if then their uncircumcised heart be humbled,
and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity; then will
I remember My covenant with Jacob; and also My covenant with
Isaac, and also My covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I
will remember the land. The land also shall be left of them, and
shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them; and
they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even
because they rejected My judgments, and their soul abhorred My
statutes. And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their
enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy
them utterly, and to break My covenant with them: for I am the
Lord their God: but I will for their sakes remember the covenant of
their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the
sight of the nations, that I might be their God: I am the Lord.
These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the Lord
made between Him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the
hand of Moses."</p></blockquote>

<p>So, if Israel should not obey the commandments
of the Lord, but break that covenant which they had
made with Him, when they had said unto the Lord
(Exod. xxiv. 7): "All that the Lord hath spoken will we
do, and be obedient;" then they are threatened, first
in a general way (vv. 14-17) with terrible judgments,
which shall reverse, and more than reverse, all the
blessings. God will appoint over them "terror;"
disease shall ravage them, consumption and fever;
their enemies shall lay waste the land, defeat them in
battle, and rule over them; and instead of five of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
chasing an hundred, they should flee when none was
pursuing (vv. 17, 18). Then follow four series of
threats, each conditioned by the supposition that through
what they should have already experienced of Jehovah's
judgment, they should not repent; each also introduced
by the formula, "I will chastise (or "smite") you
seven times for your sins." In this four times repeated
series of denunciations, thus introduced, we are not to
insist that numerical precision was intended; neither
can we, with some, give to the "seven times" a
numerical or temporal reference. The thought which
runs through all these denunciations, and determines
the form which they take, is this: that the judgments
threatened as to follow each new display of hardness
and impenitence on the part of Israel shall be marked
by continually increasing severity; and the phrase
"seven times," by the reference to the sacred number
"seven," intimates that the vengeance should be "the
vengeance of the covenant" (ver. 25), and also the
awful thoroughness and completeness with which
the threatened judgments, in case of their continued
obduracy, would be inflicted.</p>

<p>This interpretation is sustained by the details of each
section. The first series (vv. 18-20), in which the
threatenings of vv. 14-17 are developed, adds to what
had been previously threatened, the withholding of
harvest for lack of rain. He who had promised to
send the rains "in their season," if they were obedient,
now declares that if they will not hearken unto Him
for the other chastisements before denounced, He will
"make their heaven as iron, and their earth as brass."
The second series threatens in addition their devastation
by wild beasts, which shall rob them of their
children and their cattle; and also, in consequence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
these great judgments, with a great diminution of their
numbers. The third series (vv. 23-26) repeats,
under forms still more intense, the threats of sword,
pestilence, and famine. The staff of bread shall be
broken, and when, stricken with pestilence, they are
gathered together in their cities, one oven shall suffice
ten women for their baking, and bread shall be
distributed by rations and in insufficient quantity
(vv. 25, 26).</p>

<p>It is intimated that with these extraordinary judgments
it shall become increasingly evident that it is
Jehovah who is thus dealing with them for the breach
of His covenant. This is suggested (ver. 24) by the
emphatic use of the personal pronoun in the Hebrew,
only to be rendered in English by a stress of voice;
and by the declaration (ver. 25) that the sword which
should be brought upon them should "execute the
vengeance of the covenant."</p>

<p>The same remark applies with still more emphasis to
the next and last of these sub-sections (vv. 27-39), the
terrific denunciations of which are introduced by these
words, which almost seem to flash with the fire of
God's avenging wrath: "If ... ye will walk contrary
unto Me; then I will walk contrary unto you in fury
(<em>lit.</em>, "I will walk with you in fury of opposition");
and I also will chastise you seven times for your sins."
All that has been threatened before is here repeated
with every circumstance which could add terror to the
picture. Was famine threatened? it shall be so awful
in its severity that they shall eat the flesh of their
own sons and daughters. The high places which had
been the scenes of their licentious worship should
be destroyed, and the "sun-images" which they had
worshipped, going after Baal, should be cut down;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>
and, in visible sign of the Divine wrath and of God's
holy contempt for the impotent idols for which they
had forsaken the Lord, upon the fallen idols should lie
the dead corpses of their worshippers. The sanctuaries
(with special,&mdash;though, perhaps, not exclusive,&mdash;reference,
as the following words show, to the holy
places of Jehovah's tabernacle or temple) should
become a desolation; the sweet savour of their sacrifices
should be rejected. The holy people should be
scattered into other lands; the land should become so
desolate that those of their enemies who should dwell
in it should themselves be astonished at its transformation.
And so, while they should be scattered
in their enemies' land, the land would "enjoy her
sabbaths;"<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> <em>i.e.</em>, it should thus, untilled and desolate,
enjoy the rest which Jehovah had commanded them
to give the land each seventh year, which they had not
observed. Meanwhile, the condition of the banished
nation in the lands of their captivity should be most
pitiful: minished in number, those that were left alive
should pine away in their iniquities, and in the iniquity
of their fathers; timid and broken-spirited, they should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
flee before the sound of a broken leaf, and the land of
their enemies should "eat them up."</p>

<p>And herewith ends the second section of this remarkable
prophecy. Promising Israel the highest
prosperity in the land of Canaan, if they will keep the
words of this covenant, it threatens them with successive
judgments of sword, famine, and pestilence, of
continually increasing severity, to culminate, if they
yet persist in disobedience, in their expulsion from the
land for a prolonged period; and predicts their continued
existence, despite the most distressing conditions,
in the lands of their enemies, while their own land
meanwhile lies desolate and untilled without them.</p>

<p>The fundamental importance and instructiveness of
this prophecy is evident from the fact that all later
predictions concerning the fortunes of Israel are but
its more detailed exposition and application to successive
historical conditions. Still more evident is its
profound significance when we recall to mind the fact,
disputed by none, that not only is it an epitome of all
later prophecy of Holy Scripture concerning Israel,
but, no less truly, an epitome of Israel's history. So
strictly true is this that we may accurately describe the
history of that nation, from the days of Moses until
now, as but the translation of this chapter from the
language of prediction into that of history.</p>

<p>The facts which illustrate this statement are so
familiar that one scarcely needs to refer to them. The
numerous visitations in the days of the Judges, when
again and again the people were given into the hands
of their enemies for their sins, and so often as then
they repented, were again and again delivered; the
heavier judgments of later days, first in the days of
the earlier kings, and afterwards culminating in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
captivity of the ten tribes, following the siege and
capture of Samaria, 721 <small>B.C.</small>; and still later, the terrible
siege and capture of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar,
586 <small>B.C.</small>, to the horrors of which the Lamentations of
Jeremiah bear most sorrowful witness;&mdash;what were
all these events, with others of lesser importance, but
an historical unfolding of this twenty-sixth chapter
of Leviticus?</p>

<p>And how, since Old Testament days, this prophecy
has been continually illustrated in Israel's history, is,
or should be, familiar to all. As apostasy has succeeded
to apostasy, judgment has followed upon judgment.
To a Nebuchadnezzar succeeded an Antiochus
Epiphanes; and, after the Greco-Syrian judgment, then,
following the supreme national crime of the rejection
and crucifixion of their promised Messiah, came the
Roman captivity, the most terrible of all; a judgment
continued even until now in the eighteen hundred
years of Israel's exile from the land of the covenant,
and their scattering among the nations,&mdash;eighteen
hundred years of tragic suffering, such as no other
nation has ever known, or, knowing, has yet survived;
sufferings which are still exhibited before the eyes of
all the world to-day in the bitter experiences of the
four millions of Jews in the Empire of the Czar, and
the persecutions of Anti-Shemitism in other lands.</p>

<p>Existing, rather than living, under such conditions
for centuries, as a natural result, the Jewish people
became few in number, as here predicted; having been
reduced from not less than seven or eight millions in
the days of the kingdom, to a minimum, about two
hundred years ago, of not more than three millions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
And, strangest of all, throughout this time the once
fertile land has lain desolate, for the Gentiles have
never settled in it in any great number; and in place
of a population of five hundred to the square mile in
the days of Solomon, we find now only a few hundred
thousand miserable people, and the most of the land,
for lack of cultivation, in such a condition that nothing
can easily exceed its desolation. And when we have
said all this, and much more that might be said without
exaggeration, we have but simply testified that
vv. 31-34 of this chapter have in the fullest possible
sense become historical fact. For it was written (vv.
32-34): "I will bring the land into desolation: and
your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished
at it. And you will I scatter among the nations, and I
will draw out the sword after you: and your land shall
be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste.
Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it
lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies' land; even
then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths."</p>

<p>These facts make this chapter to be an apologetic of
prime importance. It is this, because we have here
evidence of foreknowledge, and therefore of the supernatural
inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God in the
prophecy here recorded. The facts cannot be adequately
explained, either on the supposition of fortunate
guessing or of accidental coincidence. It was not
indeed impossible to forecast on natural grounds that
Israel would become corrupt, or that, if so, they should
experience disaster in consequence of their moral depravation.
For God has not one law for Israel and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
another for other nations. Nor does the argument rest
on the details of these threatened judgments, as consisting
in the sword, famine, and pestilence; for other
nations have experienced these calamities, though,
indeed, few in equal measure with Israel; and of these
one has a natural dependence on another.</p>

<p>But setting aside these elements of the prophecy,
as of less apologetic significance, two particulars yet
remain in which this predicted experience has been
unique, and antecedently to the event in so high degree
improbable, that we can reasonably think here neither
of shrewd human forecast nor of chance agreement of
prediction and fulfilment. The one is the predicted
survival of exiled Israel as a nation in the land of their
enemies, their indestructibility throughout centuries of
unequalled suffering; the other, the extraordinary fact
that their land, so rich and fertile, which was at that
time and for centuries afterwards one of the principal
highways of the world's commerce and travel, the
coveted possession of many nations from a remote
antiquity, should during the whole period of Israel's
banishment remain comparatively unoccupied and
untilled.</p>

<p>As regards the former particular, we may search
history in vain for a similar phenomenon. Here is a
people who, at their best, as compared with many
other nations, such as the Egyptians, Babylonians,
and Romans, were few in number and in material
resources; who now have been scattered from their
land for centuries, crushed and oppressed always, in
a degree and for a length of time never experienced by
any other people; yet never merging in the nations
with whom they were mingled, or losing in the least
their peculiar racial characteristics and distinct national<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
identity. This, although now for a long time matter
of history, was yet, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à priori</i>, so improbable that all
history records no other instance of the kind; and
yet all this had to be if those words of ver. 44 were
to prove true: "When they be in the land of their
enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor
them, to destroy them utterly." With abundant reason
has Professor Christlieb referred to this fact as an
unanswerable apologetic, thus: "We point to the people
of Israel as a perennial historical miracle. The continued
existence of this nation up to the present day,
the preservation of its national peculiarities throughout
thousands of years, in spite of all dispersion and
oppression, remains so unparalleled a phenomenon, that
without the special providential preparation of God,
and His constant interference and protection, it would
be impossible for us to explain it. For where else is
there a people over which such judgments have passed,
and yet not ended in destruction?"<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>No less remarkable and significant is the long-continued
depopulation of the land of Israel. For it was
and is by nature a richly fertile land; and at the time
of this prediction&mdash;whether it be assigned to an earlier
or a later period&mdash;it was upon one of the chief commercial
and military routes of the world, and its possession
has thus been an object of ambition to all the
dominant nations of history. Surely, one would have
expected that if Israel should be cast out of such a
land, it would at once and always be occupied by others
who should cultivate its proverbially productive soil.
But it was not to be so, for it had been otherwise
written. And yet it seems as if it had scarcely been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
possible that through all these later centuries of the
history of Christendom, the land could have thus lain
desolate, except for the so momentous discovery in
1497 of the Cape route to India, by which event&mdash;which
no one could in so remote days have well
anticipated&mdash;the tide of commerce with the East was
turned away from Egypt, Syria, and Palestine, to the
Atlantic and the Indian Oceans; so that the land of
Israel was left, like a city made to stand solitary in a
desert by the shifting of the channel of a river; and its
predicted desolation thus went on to receive its most
complete, consummate, and now long-realised fulfilment.</p>

<p>So, then, stands the case. It is truly difficult to
understand how one can fairly escape the inference
from these facts, namely, that they imply in this
chapter such a prescience of the future as is not
possible to man, and therefore demonstrate that the
Spirit of God must, in the deepest and truest sense,
have been the author of these predictions of the future
of the chosen people and their land.</p>

<p>And it is of the very first importance, with reference
to the controversies of our day regarding this question,
that we note the fact that the argument is of such a
nature that it is not in the least dependent upon the
date that any may have assigned to the origin of this
chapter. Even though we should, with Graf and Wellhausen,
attribute its composition to exilian or post-exilian
times, it would still remain true that the chapter
contained unmistakable predictions regarding the nation
and the land; predictions which, if fulfilled, no doubt,
in a degree, in the days of the Babylonian exile and the
return, were yet to receive a fulfilment far more minute,
exhaustive, and impressive, in centuries which then
were still in a far distant future. But if this be granted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
it is plain that these facts impose a limitation upon the
conclusions of criticism. That only is true science
which takes into view <em>all</em> the facts with respect to any
phenomenon for which one seeks to account; and in
this case the facts which are to be explained by any
theory, are not merely peculiarities of style and vocabulary,
etc., but also this phenomenon of a demonstrably
predictive element in the chapter; a phenomenon which
requires for its explanation the assumption of a supernatural
inspiration as one of the factors in its authorship.
But if this is so, how can we reconcile with such
a Divine inspiration any theory which makes the last
statement of the chapter, that "these are the statutes
which the Lord made ... in mount Sinai by the hand
of Moses," to be untrue, and the preceding "laws" to
be thus, in plain language, a forgery of exilian or
post-exilian times?</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Promised Restoration.</span></p>

<p class="center">xxvi. 40-45.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their
fathers, in their trespass which they trespassed against Me, and also
that because they have walked contrary unto Me, I also walked contrary
unto them, and brought them into the land of their enemies: if
then their uncircumcised heart be humbled, and they then accept of
the punishment of their iniquity; then will I remember My covenant
with Jacob; and also My covenant with Isaac, and also My covenant
with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land. The
land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she
lieth desolate without them; and they shall accept of the punishment
of their iniquity: because, even because they rejected My judgments,
and their soul abhorred My statutes. And yet for all that, when they
be in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I
abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break My covenant with
them: for I am the Lord their God: but I will for their sakes remember
the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the
land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God:
I am the Lord."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span></p>

<p>This closing section of this extraordinary chapter
yet remains to be considered. It is the most remarkable
of all, whether from a historical or a religious
point of view. It declares that even under so extreme
visitations of Divine wrath, and howsoever long Israel's
stubborn rebellion and impenitence should continue,
yet the nation should never become extinct and pass
away. Very impressive are the words (vv. 43-45)
which emphasise this prediction: "The land also shall
be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she
lieth desolate without them; and they shall accept<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> of
the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because
they rejected My judgments, and their soul abhorred
My statutes. And yet for all that, when they be
in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them,
neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly,
and to break My covenant with them: for I am the
Lord their God: but I will for their sakes remember
the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth
out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations,
that I might be their God: I am the Lord."</p>

<p>As to what is included in this promise of everlasting
covenant mercy, we are told explicitly (ver. 40)<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> that as
the final result of these repeated and long-continued
judgments, the children of Israel "shall confess their iniquity,
and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
which they trespassed" against the Lord. Also they
will acknowledge (ver. 41) that all these calamities have
been sent upon them by the Lord; that it is because
they have walked contrary unto Him that He has also
walked contrary unto them, and brought them into the
land of their enemies. And then follows the great
promise (vv. 41, 42): "If then their uncircumcised
heart be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment
of their iniquity; then will I remember My
covenant with Jacob; and also My covenant with Isaac,
and also My covenant with Abraham will I remember;
and I will remember the land."</p>

<p>These words are very full and explicit. That they
have had already a partial and inadequate fulfilment
in the restoration from Babylon, and the spiritual
quickening by which it was accompanied, is not to be
denied. But one only needs to refer to the covenants
to which reference is made, and especially the covenant
with Abraham, as recorded in the book of Genesis,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> to
see that by no possibility can that Babylonian restoration
be said to have exhausted this prophecy. Since
those earlier days Israel has again forsaken the Lord,
and committed the greatest of all their national sins in
the rejection and crucifixion of the promised Messiah;
and therefore, again, according to the threat of the
earlier part of this chapter, they have been cast out
of their land and scattered among the nations, and the
land, again, for centuries has been left a desolation.
But for all this, God's covenant with Israel has not
lapsed, nor, as we are here formally assured, can it ever
lapse. To imagine, with some, that because of the new
dispensation of grace to the Gentiles which has come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>
in, therefore the promises of this covenant have become
void, is a mistake which is fatal to all right understanding
of the prophetic word. As for the spiritual
blessing of true repentance and a national turning unto
God, Zechariah, after the Babylonian captivity, represents
the prediction as yet to have a larger and far
more blessed fulfilment, in a day which, beyond all
controversy, has never yet risen on the world. For
it is written (Zech. xii. 8-14; xiii. 1): "In that
day ... I will pour upon the house of David, and
upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace
and of supplication; and they shall look unto Me whom
they have pierced: and they shall mourn for Him, as
one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness
for Him, as one that is in bitterness for his
firstborn; ... all the families that remain, every
family apart, and their wives apart. In that day there
shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and
to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for uncleanness."
And that this great promise, which implies by
its very terms the previous "piercing" of the Messiah,
is still valid for the nation in the new dispensation, is
expressly testified by the Apostle Paul, who formally
teaches, with regard to Israel, that "God did not cast
off His people which He foreknew;" that "the gifts and
calling of God are without repentance;" and that therefore
the days are surely coming when "all Israel
shall be saved" (Rom. xi. 2, 29, 26).</p>

<p>And while nothing is said in this chapter of Leviticus
as to the relation of this future repentance of Israel to
the establishment of the kingdom of God, we only speak
according to the express teaching both of the later
prophets and of the apostles, when we add that we are
not to think of this covenant of God concerning Israel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>
as of little consequence to our faith and hope as
Christians. For we are plainly taught, with regard to
the present exclusion and impenitence of Israel (Rom.
xi. 15), that "the receiving of them" again shall be as
"life from the dead;" which, again, is only what long
before had been declared in the Old Testament (Psalm
cii. 13-16); that when God shall arise and have mercy
upon Zion, and the set time to have pity upon her
shall come, the nations shall fear the name of the Lord,
and all the kings of the earth His glory.</p>

<p>And while we may grant that the matter is in itself
of less moment, it is yet of importance to observe that
the very covenant which promises spiritual mercy to
the people, as explicitly assures us (ver. 42) that, when
Israel confesses its sin, God "will remember the land"
as well as the people. All that has been said for the
present and unchangeable validity of the former part of
this promise, is of necessity true for this latter part
also. To affirm the former, and on that ground maintain
the faith and expectation of the future repentance
of Israel, and yet deny the latter part of this promise,
which is no less verbally explicit, regarding the land
of Israel, is an inconsistency of interpretation which is
as astonishing as it is common. For the restoration
of the scattered nation to their land is repeatedly promised,
as here, in connection with, and yet in clear
distinction from, their conversion, by both the pre- and
post-exilian prophets. And if, for reasons not hard to
discover, the promise concerning the land is not in so
many words repeated in the New Testament, its future
fulfilment is yet, to say the least, distinctly assumed
in the prediction of Christ (Luke xxi. 24), that Israel,
because of their rejection of Him, should be "led captive
into all the nations, and Jerusalem be trodden down of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span>
the Gentiles,"&mdash;not for ever, but only&mdash;"until the times
of the Gentiles be fulfilled." Surely these words of our
Lord imply that, whenever these "times of the Gentiles"
shall have run their course, their present domination
over the Holy City and the Holy Land shall end.</p>

<p>Nor is such a restoration of Israel to their land, with
all that it implies, inconsistent, as some have urged,
with the spirit and principles of the Gospel. Many a
Gentile nation is greatly favoured of the Lord, and, as
one mark of that favour, is permitted to abide in peace
and prosperity in their own land. Why should it be
any more alien to the spirit of the Gospel that penitent
Israel should be blessed in like manner, and, upon their
turning unto the Lord, also, like many other nations,
be permitted to dwell in peace and safety in that land
which lies almost empty and desolate for them until
this day? And if it be urged that, admitting this
interpretation, we shall also be obliged to admit that
Israel is in the future to be exalted to a position of
pre-eminence among the nations, which, again, is inconsistent,
it is said, with the principles of the Gospel
dispensation, we must again deny this last assertion,
and for a similar reason. If not inconsistent with the
Gospel that the British nation, for example, should
to-day hold a position of exceptional eminence and
world-wide influence among the nations, how can it be
inconsistent with the Gospel that Israel, when repentant
before God, should be in like manner exalted of Him
to national eminence and glory?</p>

<p>While in itself this question may be of little consequence,
yet in another aspect it is of no small moment
that we steadfastly affirm the permanent validity of
this part of the promise of the covenant with Israel as
given in this chapter. For it is not too much to say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>
that the logic and the exegesis which make the promise
to have become void with regard to Israel's land, if
accepted, would equally justify one in affirming the
abrogation of the promise of Israel's final repentance,
if the exigencies of any eschatological theory should
seem to require it. Either both parts of this promise
in ver. 42 are still valid, or neither is now valid; and
if either is still in force, the other is in force also.
These two, the promise concerning the people, and the
promise concerning the land, stand or fall together.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.</a></h2>

<h3><em>CONCERNING VOWS.</em></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lev.</span> xxvii. 1-34.</p>


<p>As already remarked, the book of Leviticus certainly
seems, at first sight, to be properly completed
with the previous chapter; and hence it has been not
unnaturally suggested that this chapter has by some
editor been transferred, either of intention or accident,
from an earlier part of the book&mdash;as, <em>e.g.</em>, after chapter
<small>XXV</small>. The question is one of no importance; but it is
not hard to perceive a good reason for the position of
this chapter after not only the rest of the law, but also
after the words of promise and threatening which conclude
and seal its prescriptions. For what has preceded
has concerned duties of religion which were obligatory
upon all Israelites; the regulations of this chapter,
on the contrary, have to do with special vows, which
were obligatory on no one, and concerning which it is
expressly said (Deut. xxiii. 22): "If thou shalt forbear
to vow, it shall be no sin in thee." To these,
therefore, the promises and threats of the covenant
could not directly apply, and therefore the law which
regulates the making and keeping of vows is not unfitly
made to follow, as an appendix, the other legislation
of the book.</p>

<p>Howsoever the making of vows be not obligatory as
a necessary part of the religious life, yet, in all ages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>
and in all religions, a certain instinct of the heart has
often led persons, either in order to procure something
from God, or as a thank-offering for some special favour
received, or else as a spontaneous expression of love
to God, to "make a special vow." But just in proportion
to the sincerity and depth of the devout feeling
which suggests such special acts of worship and devotion,
will be the desire to act in the vow, as in all else,
according to the will of God, so that the vow may be
accepted of Him. What then may one properly dedicate
to God in a vow? And, again, if by any stress of
circumstances a man feels compelled to seek release
from a vow, is he at liberty to recall it? and if so,
then under what conditions? Such are the questions
which in this chapter were answered for Israel.</p>

<p>As for the matter of a vow, it is ruled that an
Israelite might thus consecrate unto the Lord either
persons, or of the beasts of his possession, or his dwelling,
or the right in any part of his land. On the other
hand, "the firstling among beasts" (vv. 26, 27), any
"devoted thing" (vv. 28, 29), and the tithe (vv. 30-33)
might not be made the object of a special vow, for the
simple reason that on various grounds each of these
belonged unto the Lord as His due already. Under
each of these special heads is given a schedule of valuation,
according to which, if a man should wish for any
reason to redeem again for his own use that which,
either by prior Divine claim or by a special vow, had
been dedicated to the Lord, he might be permitted to
do so.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Of the Vowing of Persons.</span></p>

<p class="center">xxvii. 1-8.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children
of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall accomplish a vow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>
the persons shall be for the Lord by thy estimation. And thy estimation
shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty
years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after
the shekel of the sanctuary. And if it be a female, then thy estimation
shall be thirty shekels. And if it be from five years old even
unto twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male
twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels. And if it be from a
month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of
the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall
be three shekels of silver. And if it be from sixty years old and
upward; if it be a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels,
and for the female ten shekels. But if he be poorer than thy estimation,
then he shall be set before the priest, and the priest shall value
him; according to the ability of him that vowed shall the priest
value him."</p></blockquote>

<p>First, we have the law (vv. 2-8) concerning the
vowing of persons. In this case it does not appear
that it was intended that the personal vow should be
fulfilled by the actual devotement of the service of the
person to the sanctuary. For such service abundant
provision was made by the separation of the Levites,
and it can hardly be imagined that under ordinary
conditions it would be possible to find special occupation
about the sanctuary for all who might be prompted
thus to dedicate themselves by a vow to the Lord.
Moreover, apart from this, we read here of the vowing
to the Lord of young children, from five years of age
down to one month, from whom tabernacle service is
not to be thought of.</p>

<p>The vow which dedicated the person to the Lord
was therefore usually discharged by the simple expedient
of a commutation price to be paid into the
treasury of the sanctuary, as the symbolic equivalent
of the value of his self-dedication. The persons thus
consecrated are said to be "for the Lord," and this
fact was to be recognised and their special dedication to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
Him discharged by the payment of a certain sum of
money. The amount to be paid in each instance is
fixed by the law before us, with an evident reference
to the labour value of the person thus given to the
Lord in the vow, as determined by two factors&mdash;the
sex and the age. Inasmuch as the woman is inferior
in strength to the man, she is rated lower than he is.
As affected by age, persons vowed are distributed into
four classes: the lowest, from one month up to five
years; the second, from five years to twenty; the
third, from twenty to sixty; the fourth, from sixty
years of age and upwards.</p>

<p>The law takes first (vv. 3, 4) the case of persons in
the prime of their working powers, from twenty to
sixty years old, for whom the highest commutation rate
is fixed; namely, fifty shekels for the male and thirty
for a female, "after the shekel of the sanctuary," <em>i.e.</em>,
of full standard weight. If younger than this, obviously
the labour value of the persons service would
be less; it is therefore fixed (ver. 5) at twenty shekels
for the male and ten for the female, if the age be from
five to twenty; and if the person be over sixty, then
(ver. 7), as the feebleness of age is coming on, the rate
is fifteen shekels for the male and ten for the female.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
In the case of a child from one month to five years
old, the rate is fixed (ver. 6) at five, or, in a female,
then at three shekels. In this last case it will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>
observed that the rate for the male is the same as that
appointed (Numb. xviii. 15, 16) for the redemption of
the firstborn, "from a month old," in all cases. As in
that ordinance, so here, the payment was merely a
symbolic recognition of the special claim of God on the
person, without any reference to a labour value.</p>

<p>But although the sum was so small that even at the
most it could not nearly represent the actual value of
the labour of such as were able to labour, yet one can
see that cases might occur when a man might be moved
to make such a vow of dedication of himself or of a
child to the Lord, while he was yet too poor to pay
even such a small amount. Hence the kindly provision
(ver. 8) that if any person be poorer than this
estimation, he shall not therefore be excluded from the
privilege of self-dedication to the Lord, but "he shall
be set before the priest, and the priest shall value him;
according to the ability of him that vowed shall the
priest value him."</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Of the Vowing of Domestic Animals.</span></p>

<p class="center">xxvii. 9-13.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And if it be a beast, whereof men offer an oblation unto the
Lord, all that any man giveth of such unto the Lord shall be holy.
He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a
good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then both it and
that for which it is changed shall be holy. And if it be any unclean
beast, of which they do not offer an oblation unto the Lord, then he
shall set the beast before the priest: and the priest shall value it,
whether it be good or bad: as thou the priest valuest it, so shall it
be. But if he will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part
thereof unto thy estimation."</p></blockquote>

<p>This next section concerns the vowing to the Lord of
domestic animals (vv. 9-13). If the animal thus dedicated
to the Lord were such as could be used in sacrifice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
then the animal itself was taken for the sanctuary
service, and the vow was unalterable and irrevocable.
If, however, the animal vowed was "any unclean
beast," then the priest (ver. 12) was to set a price
upon it, according to its value; for which, we may
infer, it was to be sold and the proceeds devoted to
the sanctuary.</p>

<p>In this case, the person who had vowed the animal
was allowed to redeem it to himself again (ver. 13)
by payment of this estimated price and one-fifth additional,
a provision which was evidently intended to
be of the nature of a fine, and to be a check upon the
making of rash vows.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Of the Vowing of Houses and Fields.</span></p>

<p class="center">xxvii. 14-25.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the
Lord, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad:
as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand. And if he that
sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part
of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be his. And if a
man shall sanctify unto the Lord part of the field of his possession, then
thy estimation shall be according to the sowing thereof: the sowing
of a homer of barley shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver. If he
sanctify his field from the year of jubilee, according to thy estimation
it shall stand. But if he sanctify his field after the jubilee, then the
priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that
remain unto the year of jubilee, and an abatement shall be made from
thy estimation. And if he that sanctified the field will indeed redeem
it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto
it, and it shall be assured to him. And if he will not redeem the
field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be
redeemed any more: but the field, when it goeth out in the jubilee,
shall be holy unto the Lord, as a field devoted; the possession thereof
shall be the priest's. And if he sanctify unto the Lord a field which
he hath bought, which is not of the field of his possession; then the
priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation unto the
year of jubilee: and he shall give thine estimation in that day, as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span>
holy thing unto the Lord. In the year of jubilee the field shall return
unto him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession
of the land belongeth. And all thy estimations shall be according to
the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel."</p></blockquote>

<p>The law regarding the consecration of a man's house
unto the Lord by a vow (vv. 14, 15) is very simple.
The priest is to estimate its value, without right of
appeal. Apparently, the man might still live in it, if
he desired, but only as one living in a house belonging
to another; presumably, a rental was to be paid, on
the basis of the priest's estimation of value, into the
sanctuary treasury. If the man wished again to
redeem it, then, as in the case of the beast that was
vowed, he must pay into the treasury the estimated
value of the house, with the addition of one-fifth.</p>

<p>In the case of the "sanctifying" or dedication of a
field by a special vow two cases might arise, which
are dealt with in succession. The first case (vv. 16-21)
was the dedication to the Lord of a field which
belonged to the Israelite by inheritance; the second
(vv. 22-24), that of one which had come to him by
purchase. In the former case, the priest was to fix a
price upon the field on the basis of fifty shekels for so
much land as would be sown with a <em>homer</em>&mdash;about
eight bushels&mdash;of barley. In case the dedication took
effect from the year of jubilee, this full price was to
be paid into the Lord's treasury for the field; but if
from a later year in the cycle, then the rate was to be
diminished in proportion to the number of years of the
jubilee period which might have already passed at the
date of the vow. Inasmuch as in the case of a field
which had been purchased, it was ordered that the
price of the estimation should be paid down to the
priest "in that day" (ver. 23) in which the appraisal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
was made, it would appear as if, in the present case,
the man was allowed to pay it annually, a shekel for
each year of the jubilee period, or by instalments
otherwise, as he might choose, as a periodic recognition
of the special claim of the Lord upon that field, in
consequence of his vow. Redemption of the field from
the obligation of the vow was permitted under the
condition of the fifth added to the priest's estimation,
<em>e.g.</em> on the payment of sixty instead of fifty shekels
(ver. 19).</p>

<p>If, however, without having thus redeemed the field,
the man who vowed should sell it to another man, it is
ordered that the field, which otherwise would revert to
him again in full right of usufruct when the jubilee
year came round, should be forfeited; so that when
the jubilee came the exclusive right of the field would
henceforth belong to the priest, as in the case of a
field devoted by the ban. The intention of this regulation
is evidently penal; for the field, during the time
covered by the vow, was in a special sense the Lord's;
and the man had the use of it for himself only upon
condition of a certain annual payment; to sell it,
therefore, during that time, was, in fact, from the
legal point of view, to sell property, absolute right in
which he had by his vow renounced in favour of the
Lord.</p>

<p>The case of the dedication in a vow of a field
belonging to a man, not as a paternal inheritance, but
by purchase (vv. 22-24), only differed from the former
in that, as already remarked, immediate payment in
full of the sum at which it was estimated was made
obligatory; when the jubilee year came, the field
reverted to the original owner, according to the law
(xxv. 28). The reason for thus insisting on full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
immediate payment, in the case of the dedication of a
field acquired by purchase, is plain, when we refer to
the law (xxv. 25), according to which the original
owner had the right of redemption guaranteed to him
at any time before the jubilee. If, in the case of such
a dedicated field, any part of the amount due to the
sanctuary were still unpaid, obviously this, as a lien
upon the land, would stand in the way of such
redemption. The regulation of immediate payment
is therefore intended to protect the original owner's
right to redeem the field.</p>

<p>Ver. 25 lays down the general principle that in all
these estimations and commutations the shekel must
be "the shekel of the sanctuary," twenty gerahs to the
shekel;&mdash;words which are not to be understood as
pointing to the existence of two distinct shekels as
current, but simply as meaning that the shekel must
be of full weight, such as only could pass current in
transactions with the sanctuary.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The "Vow" in New Testament Ethics.</span></p>

<p>Not without importance is the question whether the
vow, as brought before us here, in the sense of a
voluntary promise to God of something not due to Him
by the law, has, of right, a place in New Testament
ethics and practical life. It is to be observed in approaching
this question, that the Mosaic law here simply
deals with a religious custom which it found prevailing,
and while it gives it a certain tacit sanction, yet neither
here or elsewhere ever recommends the practice; nor
does the whole Old Testament represent God as influenced
by such a voluntary promise, to do something
which otherwise He would not have done. At the
same time, inasmuch as the religious impulse which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
prompts to the vow, howsoever liable to lead to an
abuse of the practice, may be in itself right, Moses
takes the matter in hand, as in this chapter and
elsewhere, and deals with it simply in an educational
way. If a man will vow, while it is not forbidden,
he is elsewhere (Deut. xxii. 22) reminded that there
is no special merit in it; if he forbear, he is no
worse a man.</p>

<p>Further, the evident purpose of these regulations is to
teach that, whereas it must in the nature of the case be
a very serious thing to enter into a voluntary engagement
of anything to the holy God, it is not to be done hastily
and rashly; hence a check is put upon such inconsiderate
promising, by the refusal of the law to release
from the voluntary obligation, in some cases, upon any
terms; and by its refusal, in any case, to release except
under the condition of a very material fine for breach
of promise. It was thus taught clearly that if men
made promises to God, they must keep them. The
spirit of these regulations has been precisely expressed
by the Preacher (Eccl. v. 5, 6): "Better is it that thou
shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and
not pay. Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to
sin; neither say thou before the messenger [of God],<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
that it was an error: wherefore should God be angry
at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands?"
Finally, in the careful guarding of the practice by the
penalty attached also to change or substitution in a
thing vowed, or to selling that which had been vowed
to God, as if it were one's own; and, last of all, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span>
insisting that the full-weight shekel of the sanctuary
should be made the standard in all the appraisals
involved in the vow,&mdash;the law kept steadily and uncompromisingly
before the conscience the absolute
necessity of being strictly honest with God.</p>

<p>But in all this there is nothing which necessarily
passes over to the new dispensation, except the moral
principles which are assumed in these regulations. A
hasty promise to God, in an inconsiderate spirit, even
of that which ought to be freely promised Him, is sin,
as much now as then; and, still more, the breaking of
any promise to Him when once made. So we may take
hence to ourselves the lesson of absolute honesty in all
our dealing with God,&mdash;a lesson not less needed now
than then.</p>

<p>Yet this does not touch the central question: Has
the vow, in the sense above defined&mdash;namely, the promise
to God of something not due to Him in the law&mdash;a
place in New Testament ethics? It is true that it
is nowhere forbidden; but as little is it approved. The
reference of our Lord (Matt. xv. 5, 6) to the abuse of
the vow by the Pharisees to justify neglect of parental
claims does not imply the propriety of vows at
present; for the old dispensation was then still in force.
The vows of Paul (Acts xviii. 18; xxi. 24-26) apparently
refer to the vow of a Nazarite, and in no case present
a binding example for us, inasmuch as they are but
illustrations of his frequent conformity to Jewish usages
in things involving no sin, in which he became a Jew
that he might gain the Jews. On the other hand, the
New Testament conception of Christian life and duty
seems clearly to leave no room for a voluntary promise
to God of what is not due, seeing that, through the
transcendent obligation of grateful love to the Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
for His redeeming love, there is no possible degree of
devotement of self or of one's substance which could
be regarded as not already God's due. "He died for
all, that they which live should no longer live unto
themselves, but unto Him who for their sakes died and
rose again." The vow, in the sense brought before
us in this chapter, is essentially correlated to a legal
system such as the Mosaic, in which dues to God are
prescribed by rule. In New Testament ethics, as distinguished
from those of the Old, we must therefore
conclude that for the vow there is no logical place.</p>

<p>The question is not merely speculative and unpractical.
In fact, we here come upon one of the
fundamental points of difference between Romish and
Protestant ethics. For it is the Romish doctrine that,
besides such works as are essential to a state of salvation,
which are by God made obligatory upon all, there
are other works which, as Rome regards the matter,
are not commanded, but are only made matters of
Divine counsel, in order to the attainment, by means
of their observance, of a higher type of Christian life.
Such works as these, unlike the former class, because
not of universal obligation, may properly be made the
subject of a vow. These are, especially, the voluntary
renunciation of all property, abstinence from marriage,
and the monastic life. But this distinction of precepts
and counsels, and the theory of vows, and of works of
supererogation, which Rome has based upon it, all
Protestants have with one consent rejected, and that
with abundant reason. For not only do we fail to find
any justification for these views in the New Testament,
but the history of the Church has shown, with what
should be convincing clearness, that, howsoever we
may gladly recognise in the monastic communities of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
Rome, in all ages, men and women living under special
vows of poverty, obedience, and chastity, whose purity
of life and motive, and sincere devotion to the Lord,
cannot be justly called in question, it is none the less
clear that, on the whole, the tendency of the system
has been toward either legalism on the one hand, or a
sad licentiousness of life on the other. In this matter
of vows, as in so many things, it has been the fatal
error of the Roman Church that, under the cover of a
supposed Old Testament warrant, she has returned to
"the weak and beggarly elements" which, according
to the New Testament, have only a temporary use in
the earliest childhood of religious life.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Exclusions from the Vow.</span></p>

<p class="center">xxvii. 26-33.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Only the firstling among beasts, which is made a firstling to the
Lord, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox or sheep, it is the
Lord's. And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall ransom it
according to thine estimation, and shall add unto it the fifth part
thereof: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to
thy estimation. Notwithstanding, no devoted thing, that a man shall
devote unto the Lord of all that he hath, whether of man or beast, or
of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every
devoted thing is most holy unto the Lord. None devoted, which
shall be devoted of men, shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to
death. And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land,
or of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord's: it is holy unto the Lord.
And if a man will redeem aught of his tithe, he shall add unto it the
fifth part thereof. And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatsoever
passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the Lord.
He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change
it: and if he change it at all, then both it and that for which it is
changed shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed."</p></blockquote>

<p>The remaining verses of this chapter specify three
classes of property which could not be dedicated by a
special vow, namely, "the firstling among beasts" (ver.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
26); any "devoted thing" (vv. 28, 29), <em>i.e.</em>, anything
which had been devoted to the Lord by the ban&mdash;as,
<em>e.g.</em>, all the persons and property in the city of Jericho
by Joshua (vii. 17); and, lastly, "the tithe of the
land" (ver. 30). The reason for prohibiting the vowing
of any of these is in every case one and the same;
either by the law or by a previous personal act they
already belonged to the Lord. To devote them in a
vow would therefore be to vow to the Lord that over
which one had no right. As for the firstborn, the Lord
had declared His everlasting claim on these at the time
of the Exodus (Exod. xiii. 12-15); to vow to give the
Lord His own, had been absurd. To the law previously
given, however, concerning the firstling of unclean
beasts (Exod. xiii. 13), it is here added that, if a
man wish to redeem such a firstling, the same law
shall apply as in the redemption of what has been
vowed; namely, the priest was to appraise it, and then
the man whose it had been might redeem it by the
payment of the amount thus fixed, increased by one-fifth.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Law of the Ban.</span></p>

<p class="center">xxvii. 28, 29.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Notwithstanding, no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto
the Lord of all that he hath, whether of man or beast, or of the field
of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is
most holy unto the Lord. None devoted, which shall be devoted of
men, shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death."</p></blockquote>

<p>Neither could any "devoted thing" be given to the
Lord by a vow, and for the same reason&mdash;that it belonged
to Him already. But it is added that, unlike
that which has been vowed, the Lord's firstlings and
the tithes, that which has been devoted may neither
be sold nor redeemed. If it be a person which is thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span>
"devoted," "he shall surely be put to death" (ver. 29).
The reason of this law is found in the nature of the
<em>herem</em> or ban. It devoted to the Lord only such
persons and things as were in a condition of irreformable
hostility and irreconcilable antagonism to the
kingdom of God. By the ban such were turned over
to God, in order to the total nullification of their power
for evil; by destroying whatever was capable of
destruction, as the persons and all living things that
belonged to them; and by devoting to the Lord's
service in the sanctuary and priesthood such of their
property as, like silver, gold, and land, was in its
nature incapable of destruction. In such devoted
persons or things no man therefore was allowed to
assert any personal claim or interest, such as the right
of sale or of redemption would imply. Elsewhere the
Israelite is forbidden even to desire the silver or gold
that was on the idols in devoted cities (Deut. vii. 25),
or to bring it into his house or tent, on penalty of being
himself banned or devoted like them; a threat which
was carried out in the case of Achan (Josh. vii.),
who, for appropriating a wedge of gold and a garment
which had been devoted, according to the law here and
elsewhere declared, was summarily put to death.</p>

<p>This is not the place to enter fully into a discussion
of the very grave questions which arise in connection
with this law of the ban, in which it is ordered that
"none devoted," "whether of man or beast," "shall be
ransomed," but "shall be surely put to death." The
most familiar instance of its application is furnished
by the case of the Canaanitish cities, which Joshua, in
accordance with this law of Lev. xxvii. 28, 29, utterly
destroyed, with their inhabitants and every living thing
that was in them. There are many sincere believers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
in Christ who find it almost impossible to believe that
it can be true that God commanded such a slaughter
as this; and the difficulty well deserves a brief consideration.
It may not indeed be possible wholly to
remove it from every mind; but one may well call
attention, in connection with these verses, to certain
considerations which should at least suffice very greatly
to relieve its stress.</p>

<p>In the first place, it is imperative to remember that,
if we accept the teaching of Scripture, we have before
us in this history, not the government of man, but the
government of God, a true theocracy. Now it is obvious
that if even fallible men may be rightly granted
power to condemn men to death, for the sake of the
public good, much more must this right be conceded,
and that without any limitation, to the infinitely righteous
and infallible King of kings, if, in accord with the
Scripture declarations, He was, literally and really, the
political Head (if we may be allowed the expression)
of the Israelitish nation. Further, if this absolute right
of God in matters of life and death be admitted, as it
must be, it is plain that He may rightly delegate the
execution of His decrees to human agents. If this right
is granted to one of our fellow-men, as to a king or a
magistrate, much more to God.</p>

<p>Granting that the theocratic government of Israel
was a historical fact, the only question then remaining
as to the right of the ban, concerns the justice of its
application in particular cases. With regard to this,
we may concede that it was quite possible that men
might sometimes apply this law without Divine authority;
but we are not required to defend such cases, if
any be shown, any more than to excuse the infliction
of capital punishment in America sometimes by lynch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>
law. These cases furnish no argument against its
infliction after due legal process, and by legitimate
governmental authority. As to the terrible execution
of this law of the ban, in the destruction of the
inhabitants of the Canaanitish cities, if the fact of the
theocratic authority be granted, it is not so difficult to
justify this as some have imagined. Nor, conversely,
when the actual facts are thoroughly known, can the
truth of the statement of the Scripture that God
commanded this terrible destruction, be regarded as
irreconcilable with those moral perfections which Scripture
and reason alike attribute to the Supreme Being.</p>

<p>The researches and discoveries of recent years have
let in a flood of light upon the state of society prevailing
among those Canaanitish tribes at the date of
their destruction; and they warrant us in saying that
in the whole history of our race it would be hard to
point to any civilized community which has sunken to
such a depth of wickedness and moral pollution. As
we have already seen, the book of Leviticus gives many
dark hints of unnamable horrors among the Canaanitish
races: the fearful cruelties of the worship of Molech,
and the unmentionable impurities of the cult of Ashtoreth;
the prohibition among some of these of female
chastity, requiring that all be morally sacrificed<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>&mdash;one
cannot go into these things. And when now we read
in Holy Scripture that the infinitely pure, holy, and
righteous God commanded that these utterly depraved
and abandoned communities should be extirpated from
the face of the earth, is it, after all, so hard to believe
that this should be true? Nay, may we not rather
with abundant reason say that it would have been far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span>
more difficult to reconcile with the character of God,
if He had suffered them any longer to exist?</p>

<p>Nor have we yet fully stated the case. For we must,
in addition, recall the fact that these corrupt communities,
which by this law of the ban were devoted to
utter destruction, were in no out-of-the-way corner of
the world, but on one of its chief highways. The
Ph&oelig;nicians, for instance, more than any people of that
time, were the navigators and travellers of the age; so
that from Canaan as a centre this horrible moral pestilence
was inevitably carried by them hither and
thither, a worse than the "black death," to the very
extremities of the known world. Have we then so
certainly good reason to call in question the righteousness
of the law which here ordains that no person thus
devoted should be ransomed, but be surely put to death?
Rather are we inclined to see in this law of the theocratic
kingdom, and its execution in Canaan&mdash;so often
held up as an illustration of the awful cruelty of the
old theocratic <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i>&mdash;not only a conspicuous vindication
of the righteousness and justice of God, but a no
less illustrious manifestation of His mercy;&mdash;of His
mercy, not merely to Israel, but to the whole human
race of that age, who because of this deadly infection
of moral evil had otherwise again everywhere sunk to
such unimaginable depths of depravity as to have required
a second flood for the cleansing of the world.
This certainly was the way in which the Psalmist
regarded it, when (Psalm cxxxvi. 17-22) he praised
Jehovah as One who "smote great kings, and slew
famous kings, and gave their land for an heritage, even
an heritage unto Israel His servant: for HIS MERCY
endureth for ever;" a thought which is again more
formally expressed (Psalm lxii. 12) in the words: "Unto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span>
Thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for Thou renderest to
every man according to his work."</p>

<p>Nor can we leave this law of the ban without noting
the very solemn suggestion which it contains that there
may be in the universe persons who, despite the great
redemption, are morally irredeemable, hopelessly obdurate;
for whom, under the government of a God
infinitely righteous and merciful, nothing remains but
the execution of the ban&mdash;the "eternal fire which is
prepared for the devil and his angels" (Matt. xxv. 41);
"a fierceness of fire which shall devour the adversaries"
(Heb. x. 27). And this, not merely although, but
<small>BECAUSE</small> God's "mercy endureth for ever."</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Law of the Tithe.</span></p>

<p class="center">xxvi. 30-33.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or
of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord's: it is holy unto the Lord. And
if a man will redeem aught of his tithe, he shall add unto it the fifth
part thereof. And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatsoever
passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the Lord. He
shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change
it: and if he change it at all, then both it and that for which it is
changed shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed."</p></blockquote>

<p>Last of all these exclusions from the vow is mentioned
the tithe. "Whether of the seed of the land, or of the
herd, or of the flock," it is declared to be "holy unto
the Lord;" "it is the Lord's." That because of this
it cannot be given to the Lord by a special vow, although
not formally stated, is self-evident. No man
can give away what belongs to another, or give God
what He has already. In Numb. xviii. 21 it is said that
this tenth should be given "unto the children of Levi
... for the service of the tent of meeting."</p>

<p>Most extraordinary is the contention of Wellhausen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span>
and others, that since in Deuteronomy no tithe is mentioned
other than of the product of the land, therefore,
because of the mention here also of a tithe of the herd
and the flock, we must infer that we have here a late
interpolation into the "priest-code," marking a time
when now the exactions of the priestly caste had been
extended to the utmost limit. This is not the place to
go into the question of the relation of the law of Deuteronomy
to that which we have here; but we should
rather, with Dillmann,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> from the same premisses argue
the exact opposite, namely, that we have here the very
earliest form of the tithe law. For that an ordinance
so extending the rights of the priestly class should
have been "smuggled" into the Sinaitic laws after the
days of Nehemiah, as Wellhausen, Reuss, and Kuenen
suppose, is simply "unthinkable;"<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> while, on the other
hand, when we find already in Gen. xxviii. 22 Jacob
promising unto the Lord the tenth of all that He should
give him, at a time when he was living the life of a
nomad herdsman, it is inconceivable that he should
have meant "all, <em>excepting</em> the increase of the flocks
and herds," which were his chief possession.</p>

<p>The truth is that the dedication of a tithe, in various
forms, as an acknowledgment of dependence upon and
reverence to God, is one of the most widely-spread and
best-attested practices of the most remote antiquity.
We read of it among the Romans, the Greeks, the
ancient Pelasgians, the Carthaginians, and the Ph&oelig;nicians;
and in the Pentateuch, in full accord with all
this, we find not only Jacob, as in the passage cited,
but, at a yet earlier time, Abraham, more than four
hundred years before Moses, giving tithes to Melchizedek.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span>
The law, in the exact form in which we
have it here, is therefore in perfect harmony with all
that we know of the customs both of the Hebrews
and surrounding peoples, from a time even much earlier
than that of the Exodus.</p>

<p>Very naturally the reference to the tithe, as thus
from of old belonging to the Lord, and therefore
incapable of being vowed, gives occasion to other
regulations respecting it. Like unclean animals,
houses, and lands which had been vowed, so also the
tithe, or any part of it, might be redeemed by the
individual for his own use, upon payment of the usual
mulct of one-fifth additional to its assessed value. So
also it is further ordered, with special regard to the
tithe of the herd and the flock, "that whatsoever
passeth under the rod," <em>i.e.</em>, whatever is counted, as
the manner was, by being made to pass into or out of
the fold under the herdsman's staff, "the tenth"&mdash;that
is, every tenth animal as in its turn it comes&mdash;"shall
be holy to the Lord." The owner was not to search
whether the animal thus selected was good or bad,
nor change it, so as to give the Lord a poorer animal,
and keep a better one for himself; and if he broke this
law, then, as in the case of the unclean beast vowed,
as the penalty he was to forfeit to the sanctuary both
the original and its attempted substitute, and also lose
the right of redemption.</p>

<p>A very practical question emerges just here, as to
the continued obligation of this law of the tithe.
Although we hear nothing of the tithe in the first
Christian centuries, it began to be advocated in the
fourth century by Jerome, Augustine, and others, and, as
is well known, the system of ecclesiastical tithing soon
became established as the law of the Church. Although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span>
the system by no means disappeared with the Reformation,
but passed from the Roman into the Reformed
Churches, yet the modern spirit has become more and
more adverse to the mediæval system, till, with the
progressive hostility in society to all connection of the
Church and the State, and in the Church the development
of a sometimes exaggerated voluntaryism, tithing
as a system seems likely to disappear altogether, as it
has already from the most of Christendom.</p>

<p>But in consequence of this, and the total severance
of the Church from the State, in the United States and
the Dominion of Canada, the necessity of securing adequate
provision for the maintenance and extension of
the Church, is more and more directing the attention of
those concerned in the practical economics of the Church,
to this venerable institution of the tithe as the solution
of many difficulties. Among such there are many
who, while quite opposed to any enforcement of a law
of tithing for the benefit of the Church by the civil
power, nevertheless earnestly maintain that the law of
the tithe, as we have it here, is of permanent obligation
and binding on the conscience of every Christian.
What is the truth in the matter? In particular, what
is the teaching of the New Testament?</p>

<p>In attempting to settle for ourselves this question, it
is to be observed, in order to clear thinking on this
subject, that in the law of the tithe as here declared
there are two elements&mdash;the one moral, the other legal,&mdash;which
should be carefully distinguished. First and
fundamental is the principle that it is our duty to set
apart to God a certain fixed proportion of our income.
The other and&mdash;technically speaking&mdash;<em>positive</em> element
in the law is that which declares that the proportion
to be given to the Lord is precisely one-tenth. Now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span>
of these two, the first principle is distinctly recognised
and reaffirmed in the New Testament as of continued
validity in this dispensation; while, on the other hand,
as to the precise proportion of our income to be thus
set apart for the Lord, the New Testament writers are
everywhere silent.</p>

<p>As regards the first principle, the Apostle Paul,
writing to the Corinthians, orders that "on the first
day of the week"&mdash;the day of the primitive Christian
worship&mdash;"every one" shall "lay by him in store, as
God hath prospered him." He adds that he had given
the same command also to the Churches of Galatia
(1 Cor. xvi. 1, 2). This most clearly gives apostolic
sanction to the fundamental principle of the tithe,
namely, that a definite portion of our income should
be set apart for God. While, on the other hand,
neither in this connection, where a mention of the law
of the tithe might naturally have been expected, if it
had been still binding as to the letter, nor in any other
place does either the Apostle Paul or any other New
Testament writer intimate that the Levitical law, requiring
the precise proportion of a tenth, was still in force;&mdash;a
fact which is the more noteworthy that so much is
said of the duty of Christian benevolence.</p>

<p>To this general statement with regard to the testimony
of the New Testament on this subject, the words
of our Lord to the Pharisees (Matt. xxiii. 23), regarding
their tithing of "mint and anise and cummin"&mdash;"these
ye ought to have done"&mdash;cannot be taken as an exception,
or as proving that the law is binding for this
dispensation; for the simple reason that the present
dispensation had not at that time yet begun, and those
to whom He spoke were still under the Levitical law,
the authority of which He there reaffirms. From these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span>
facts we conclude that the law of these verses, in so
far as it requires the setting apart to God of a certain
definite proportion of our income, is doubtless of continued
and lasting obligation; but that, in so far as it
requires from all alike the exact proportion of one-tenth,
it is binding on the conscience no longer.</p>

<p>Nor is it difficult to see why the New Testament
should not lay down this or any other precise proportion
of giving to income, as a universal law. It is only
according to the characteristic usage of the New
Testament law to leave to the individual conscience
very much regarding the details of worship and
conduct, which under the Levitical law was regulated
by specific rules; which the Apostle Paul explains
(Gal. iv. 1-5) by reference to the fact that the earlier
method was intended for and adapted to a lower and
more immature stage of religious development; even
as a child, during his minority, is kept under guardians
and stewards, from whose authority, when he comes
of age, he is free.</p>

<p>But, still further, it seems to be often forgotten by
those who argue for the present and permanent
obligation of this law, that it was here for the first time
formally appointed by God as a binding law, in connection
with a certain divinely instituted system of
theocratic government, which, if carried out, would, as
we have seen, effectively prevent excessive accumulations
of wealth in the hands of individuals, and thus secure
for the Israelites, in a degree the world has never seen,
an equal distribution of property. In such a system
it is evident that it would be possible to exact a
certain fixed and definite proportion of income for
sacred purposes, with the certainty that the requirement
would work with perfect justice and fairness to all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span>
But with us, social and economic conditions are so
very different, wealth is so very unequally distributed,
that no such law as that of the tithe could be made to
work otherwise than unequally and unfairly. To the
very poor it must often be a heavy burden; to the
very rich, a proportion so small as to be a practical
exemption. While, for the former, the law, if insisted
on, would sometimes require a poor man to take bread
out of the mouth of wife and children, it would still
leave the millionaire with thousands to spend on needless
luxuries. The latter might often more easily give
nine-tenths of his income than the former could give
one-twentieth.</p>

<p>It is thus no surprising thing that the inspired men
who laid the foundations of the New Testament Church
did not reaffirm the law of the tithe as to the letter.
And yet, on the other hand, let us not forget that
the law of the tithe, as regards the moral element of
the law, is still in force. It forbids the Christian to
leave, as so often, the amount he will give for the Lord's
work, to impulse and caprice. Statedly and conscientiously
he is to "lay by him in store as the Lord
hath prospered him." If any ask how much should
the proportion be, one might say that by fair inference
the tenth might safely be taken as an <em>average minimum</em>
of giving, counting rich and poor together. But the
New Testament (2 Cor. viii. 7, 9) answers after a
different and most characteristic manner: "See that
ye abound in this grace.... For ye know the grace
of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though He was rich,
yet for your sakes He became poor, that ye through His
poverty might become rich." Let there be but regular
and systematic giving to the Lord's work, under the
law of a fixed proportion of gifts to income, and under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span>
the holy inspiration of this sacred remembrance of the
grace of our Lord, and then the Lord's treasury will
never be empty, nor the Lord be robbed of His tithe.</p>

<p>And so hereupon the book of Leviticus closes with
the formal declaration&mdash;referring, no doubt, strictly
speaking, to the regulations of this last chapter&mdash;that
"these are the commandments, which the Lord commanded
Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai."
The words as explicitly assert Mosaic origin and authority
for these last laws of the book, as the opening
words asserted the same for the law of the offerings
with which it begins. The significance of these repeated
declarations respecting the origin and authority of the
laws contained in this book has been repeatedly pointed
out, and nothing further need be added here.</p>

<p>To sum up all:&mdash;what the Lord, in this book of
Leviticus, has said, was not for Israel alone. The
supreme lesson of this law is for men now, for the
Church of the New Testament as well. For the individual
and for the nation, <small>HOLINESS</small>, consisting in full
consecration of body and soul to the Lord, and separation
from all that defileth, is the Divine ideal, to the
attainment of which Jew and Gentile alike are called.
And the only <em>way</em> of its attainment is through the
atoning Sacrifice, and the mediation of the High Priest
appointed of God; and the only <em>evidence</em> of its attainment
is a joyful obedience, hearty and unreserved, to
all the commandments of God. For us all it stands
written: "<span class="smcap">Ye shall be holy; for I, Jehovah, your
God, am holy.</span>"</p>

in Modern Theology," etc. <em>Fifth Edition. Crown 8vo, cloth,
7s. 6d.</em></p>

<p class="center"><cite>The Daily Chronicle</cite>, in a Leading Article, says:</p>

<p>"Such a work cannot but have a deep effect."</p>

<p>"Dr. Fairbairn's able and striking volume.... The treatment is
throughout so thoughtful and free from narrow polemical bias."&mdash;<cite>Times.</cite></p>

<p>"The book is certainly one every theologian must welcome&mdash;high-minded
in tone, broad in its outlook, penetrating in its vision, and
full of luminous <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">apercus</i> on the history of thought and of events."&mdash;<cite>Literature.</cite></p>


<p class="center"><b>THE PLACE OF CHRIST IN MODERN<br />
THEOLOGY.</b> <em>Eleventh Edition. 8vo, cloth, 12s.</em></p>

<p>"In some respects this is a great book. It strikes out a new and
generally a fresh line of argument. The story of the development of
thought during the Christian ages is a brilliant and vivid historical
sketch, and will be a most useful piece of reference to the student."&mdash;<span class="smcap">The
Dean of Gloucester</span>, <cite>in the Pall Mall Gazette</cite>.</p>

<p>"His work is, without doubt, one of the most valuable and comprehensive
contributions to theology that has been made during this
generation."&mdash;<cite>Spectator.</cite></p>

<p>"Dr. Fairbairn starts from the principle that Christian theology
must be based on the consciousness of Christ; and from the fact that
the historical Christ is only now, nineteen centuries after His appearance
on earth, being recovered for human knowledge and faith....
A more vivid summary of Church history has never been given. With
its swift characterisation of schools and politics, with its subtle tracings
of the development of various tendencies through the influence of their
environment, of reaction, and of polemic; with its contrasts of different
systems, philosophies, and races; with its portraits of men; with its
sense of progress and revolt&mdash;this part of Dr. Fairbairn's book is no
mere annal, but drama, vivid and full of emotion, representative of the
volume and sweep of Christianity through the centuries."&mdash;<cite>Speaker.</cite></p>

<p>"The volume before us is the most weighty and important which
he has yet issued. His treatises entitled 'Studies in the Life of
Christ' and 'A City of God' contain much of great value; but in a
sense they gave promise of better things to come, and this promise
has been amply fulfilled ... in this very able and learned and altogether
admirable discussion on 'The Place of Christ in Modern
Theology.' ... The book is evidently one for the times, and doubtless
attention will be widely drawn to it on account of the great
importance of the subject of which it treats, the honoured name of
its author, and the conspicuous ability, the competent learning, and
the gracious spirit which it everywhere displays."&mdash;<cite>Scotsman.</cite></p></blockquote>

among different writers, on the score of variety in literary
execution, why may not these have been engaged jointly with Moses
himself in preparing each his appointed portion, and the whole have
been finally reduced by Moses to its present form?... Why might

priesthood, to whom was entrusted the transmission, interpretation, and
administration of the law. We admit this willingly; and even the
participation of Ezra in this codification in itself furnishes no stumbling
block for us. For it is not inconceivable that laws which until
then had been handed down orally were fixed by him in writing to
secure their judicial authority and execution. The most important
thing for us is the historico-traditional character of the Pentateuchal
legislation, and especially the occasions for (the laws) and the fundamental
arrangements in the history of the times. That which we
cannot be persuaded to admit is that the so-called Priestly Code is
the work of the free invention of the latest date, which takes on the
artificial appearance of ancient history."&mdash;<cite>The Presbyterian Review</cite>,

<p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> A striking parallel to this ordinance is found in a caste custom
in North India, where the caste Hindoo, as I have often seen, if he
give you a drink of water in a vessel, will only use an earthen vessel,
which, immediately after you have drunk, he breaks, to preclude the
possibility of its accidental use thereafter, by which ceremonial defilement
might be contracted. For the Hindoo does not regard it as
possible so to cleanse a metallic vessel as to remove the defilement
thus caused; and as he could not afford to throw it away, he will
give one to drink in the cheap earthen vessel, or else no drink at all.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> It is to be regretted that the Revisers had not allowed in this
case the rendering "trespass-offering" to stand, as in the Authorised
Version. For, unlike the more generic term "guilt," our word
"trespass" very precisely indicates the class of offences for which
this particular offering was ordained. It is indeed true that the
Hebrew word so rendered is quite distinct from that rendered "trespass;"
yet, in this instance, by the attempt to represent this fact in
English, more has been lost than gained.</p></div>

the Apostle Paul (Rom. xv. 16), where he speaks of himself as "a

God;" in which last phrase, the Greek word denotes "ministration
as a priest." See R.V., margin.</p></div>

between chapters x. and xvi., which are so closely connected by this
historical note in xvi. 1, certainly suggests an editorial redaction&mdash;as
the phrase is&mdash;in which the latter chapter, for whatsoever reason,
has been removed from its original context. But that such a

principal features was already issued by Moses does not admit of
demonstration to him who wills not to believe it; but that it cannot
have been in the first instance the invention of a post-exilian scribe
is certain. Only in the simpler communal relations of the more
ancient time could a law of such an ideal character have seemed
practicable; after the exile, all the presuppositions involved in its
promulgation are wanting" ("Die Bücher Exodus und Leviticus," 2
Aufl., p. 608).</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_48_48" id="Footnote_48_48"></a><a href="#FNanchor_48_48"><span class="label">[48]</span></a> The interpretation of ver. 33 presents a difficulty which, if the
rendering retained in the text by the Revisers be accepted, is hard to
resolve. But if we assume that a negative has fallen out of the first
clause in the received text, and read with the Vulgate, as given in the
margin of the Revised Version, "if one of the Levites redeem <em>not</em>," all
becomes clear. In the exposition we have ventured to assume in this
instance the correctness of the Vulgate.</p></div>

sabbatic years as evidence of the late composition of the chapter;
but surely in this argument there is little force. For, even apart
from any question of inspiration, the ordinance of the sabbatic year
was of such an extraordinary character, so opposed alike to human
selfishness and eagerness for gain, and calling for such faith in God,
that it would require no great knowledge of human nature to anticipate
its probable neglect, even on natural grounds. But, even were
this not so, still an argument of this kind against the Mosaic origin
of this minatory section of the covenant can have decisive force for
those only who, for whatsoever reason, have come to disbelieve that
God can tell beforehand what free agents will do, or that, if He
know, He can impart that knowledge to His servants.</p></div>

sec. 15) estimated it in his day. Since then, however, their number
has materially increased, and is still increasing; a fact the significance
of which has been pointed out by the present writer in "The
Jews; or, Prediction and Fulfilment" (New York, 1883, pp. 178-83).</p></div>

applied to the land and "accept" when applied to Israel: it might
thus be rendered "enjoy" in the latter case&mdash;"they shall enjoy the
punishment of their iniquity," when the words would express a

could not have represented the actual value of the individual's
labour. The highest sum which is named&mdash;fifty shekels&mdash;as the rate
for a man from twenty to sixty years of age, taking the shekel as
2s. 3·37<em>d.</em>, or $·5474, would only amount to £5 14<em>s.</em> 0&frac34;<em>d.</em>, or
$27·375. Even from this alone it is clear that, as stated above, the
chief reference in these figures must have been symbolic of a claim
of God upon the person, graded according to his capacity for service.</p></div>

with the suggestion of the margin (R.V.). The reference is to the
priest, as Mal. ii. 7 makes very clear: "He [the priest] is the
